      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1071">'''The Star Wars Corporation, Inc.''' ('''SWC''') was a company founded by [[George Lucas]] in 1973. It was a subsidiary of his [[Lucasfilm]] production company, set up to control various legal and financial aspects of his 1977 movie ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', including copyright, and sequel and merchandising rights. By 1980, the company had been discontinued and its business was absorbed into the various divisions of its parent company Lucasfilm Ltd.

The corporation's name may still be seen on certain ''Star Wars'' related items, such as the end credits copyright notice of the film itself, and in reprints of ''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]'' and ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' as the copyrights have not expired or been renewed.

{{Original research|date=October 2007}}
The [[fictional universe]] of [[Star Wars]] contains many [[language]]s. The languages have a role in the [[Narrative thread|story lines]]. Because of the various languages characters speak in Star Wars they often cannot understand each other. The character [[C-3PO]] is a translator fluent in over six million forms of communication&lt;ref&gt;Neil Frude, ''The Robot Heritage'' (Century Pub., 1984), [http://books.google.com/books?id=CDhSAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=C-3PO+%22fluent+in%22+%22languages%22&amp;dq=C-3PO+%22fluent+in%22+%22languages%22&amp;ei=eTYaSd7sFY3IMtf64Y8L&amp;pgis=1 176].&lt;/ref&gt; who acts as a go-between for other characters in the stories.

[[File:Star-Wars-aurek-besh-alphabet-chart.svg|thumb|320px|&quot;Aurebesh&quot; alphabet]]
==Basic - the common galactic language==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Wookieee]] --&gt;
The [[spoken language]] most often heard, a [[lingua franca]], in the ''Star Wars'' films and stories is ''Galactic Basic'' (shortened to Basic), although this name itself is never explicitly mentioned in the [[film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic p.173–178 previewed at http://books.google.com/books?id=cQhke8K9G60C&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=%22Star+Wars%22+languages&amp;ei=kpkYSYPCDI-SMpaTrdQE&lt;/ref&gt;  Basic is heard or printed in the vernacular of the audience ([[English (language)|English]] in English versions, [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] in Spanish translations, etc.) and most often written in &quot;Aurebesh&quot;, an alphabet which has letters corresponding to each of the 26 letters of the [[basic Latin alphabet]], as well as letters representing Latin [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s (letter combinations) such as &quot;th&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, etc.

==Other Languages==

===Bocce===
Bocce is a language of trade within the [[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Universe]]. Developed by a merchant fleet, it combines multiple languages to provide trade communication between different species.

===Huttese===

Another [[lingua franca]] in the Star Wars Universe that is spoken by many groups and species is [[Hutt_(Star_Wars)#Huttese_language|Huttese]], spoken on [[Nal Hutta]], [[Nar_Shaddaa]], [[Tatooine]] and other worlds in and around Hutt space. It is spoken in the films by both non-humans ([[Jabba the Hutt]], [[Watto]], [[List of Star Wars characters#S|Sebulba]] and others) and humans. In fact, the whole [[Max Rebo Band]] communicates and sings in Huttese.  Its phonology is said to be based on the [[Quechua language]].&lt;ref&gt;Crit Minster, Paula Newton, and Ricardo Segreda, ''Viva Travel Guide to Peru: Exploring Machu Picchu, Cusco, the Inca Trail, Arequipa, Lake Titicaca, Lima and Beyond'' (Viva Travel Guide to Peru: Exploring Machu Picchu, Cusco, the Inca Trail, Arequipa, Lake Titicaca, Lima and Beyond), [http://books.google.com/books?id=O3eK1nVLHgMC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Huttese+Quechua+language&amp;ei=_6MYSYG-MJHYMvC4gKQE 26].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal tongue of the Ewoks===
The [[Ewok]]s of the [[forest moon of Endor]] speak a &quot;primitive dialect&quot; of one of the more than six million other forms of communication that [[C-3PO]] is familiar with.  Ben Burtt, ''Return of the Jedi''’s sound designer, created the Ewok language.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Northen Magill, ''Great Events from History II: 1897–1921'' (Salem Pr Inc, 1993), [http://books.google.com/books?id=lYAYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Ewok+language%22&amp;dq=%22Ewok+language%22&amp;ei=sM4ZScr9Mpa8tgO1iPnoAQ&amp;pgis=1 2393].&lt;/ref&gt;  Burtt has told rather differing stories about how he developed the language. In ''Bantha Tracks'' #17 August 1982, he states
:&quot;For the Ewoks, I was inspired by a recording on a BBC documentary of an elderly woman speaking Tibetan. It was very high-pitched and sounded like a good basis for Ewokese to me. Eventually then, what evolved was a pidgin, or double talk version of words from Tibetan, Nepali and other Mongolian languages [''sic'', neither [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] nor [[Nepali language|Nepali]] are Mongolian languages].&quot;

Several years later, on the commentary track for the DVD of ''Return of the Jedi'', Burtt identified the language that he heard in the BBC documentary as [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]], a tongue spoken by the isolated nomadic [[Kalmyk people]]. He describes how, after some research, he identified an 80-year old Kalmyk [[refugee]]. He recorded her telling folk stories in her native language, and then used the recordings as a basis for sounds that became the Ewok language and were performed by voice actors who imitated the old woman's voice in different styles. For the scene in which C-3PO speaks Ewokese, actor [[Anthony Daniels]] worked with Burtt and invented words, based on the Kalmyk recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Burtt, DVD commentary on ''The Return of the Jedi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcia Calkovsky of Lethbridge University maintains that Tibetan language contributed to Ewok speech ''along'' with Kalmyk, starting the story from attempts to use language samples of Native Americans and later turning to 9 Tibetan women living in San Francisco area, as well as one Kalmyk woman. The story of the choice of these languages is referenced to Burtt's 1989 telephone interview, and many of the used Tibetan phrases translated. The initial prayer Ewoks address to C-3PO is actually the beginning part of Tibetan Buddhist prayer for the benefit of all sentient beings, or so called [[Four Immeasurables|four immeasurables]], but also there is a second (out of four) part of [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge prayer]]. Tibetan diaspora was puzzled as many of the phrases they could make out did not corellate to events on screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rUMWR1U7EVEC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=tibetan&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;hl=ru#PPA59,M1 Marcia S. Calkovsky. Is There Authoritative Voice in Ewok Talk? On Postmodernism, Fieldwork, and the Recovery of Unintended Meaning, in: Culture, Canadian Anthropology Society, 1991. Vol. XI №1-2.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wookiee language of Shyriiwook===

''Shyriiwook'' (also called Wookiee Speak, or contracted as &quot;Wookieespeak&quot; in the Expanded Universe, and [[video game]]s) is the native language of the [[Wookiee]] race. The language consists of [[roar (utterance)|roar]]s and growls.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Amara, Prima Temp Authors Staff, ''Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided: Prima's Official Strategy Guide'' (Prima Games, 2003), [http://books.google.com/books?id=xC8DmqQpegQC&amp;q=Shyriiwook&amp;dq=Shyriiwook&amp;ei=DaMYSbX-AZbyMvyOmeAI&amp;pgis=1 22].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it can be understood by members of other species, it is extremely difficult for those with non-Wookiee physiology to speak.  Conversely, Wookiee mouthparts physically cannot create the sounds of Galactic Basic, thus while Wookiees such as Chewbacca can understand characters speaking Basic, he cannot speak it.  In Timothy Zahn's &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, [[Leia Organa Solo]] encounters a Wookiee with a [[speech impediment]] which conveniently renders his Shyriiwook pronunciation much easier to understand by Leia. Another Wookiee language, Xaczik, is indigenous to Wartaki Island on [[Kashyyyk]] and several outlying coastal regions.

===Ithorians===
[[Ithorians]] have two mouths, one on each side of their head.  As a result, their native language is extremely complicated and essentially impossible for non-Ithorians to speak.  Despite the stereophonic quality of their voices, Ithorians are able to speak Basic, and be understood by others, with ease.

===Geonosians===
[[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Geonosian|Geonosians]], insectoid species seen in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Episode II]]'' whose language includes [[click consonant]]s.

===Tusken Raiders===
The [[Tusken Raiders]] of [[Tatooine]], according to the video game ''Knights of the Old Republic'', speak a language of their own; it is, however, difficult for non-Tuskens to understand this language. In the game, a droid named [[HK-47]] assists the player in communicating with the Tusken Raiders. In the novelizations Junior Jedi Knights and New Jedi Order series, it is revealed that Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila was raised by the Tusken Raiders after they captured her in a raid. Generally, they utter roars and battle cries when seen in public.

===Jawaese and Jawa Trade Language===
The [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Jawa|Jawas]], also found on Tatooine, speak in a high-pitched, squeaky voice. To speak to others of their species along with the voice they emit a smell showing their emotions. However when trading droids and dealing with non-Jawas they speak without the smell because many consider the smell &quot;Foul.&quot;

===Ryl language of the Twi'leks===
[[Twi'leks]] speak their own language, Ryl, which incorporates spoken words and a form of sign language, using subtle manipulations of the tips of their lekku (head tails).

===Rodian language===
[[List of Star Wars races (P-T)#Rodian|Rodian]]s have their own language called Rodese.

===Hapan language===
Hapan was the language developed by residents of the Hapes Cluster due to their isolation from the rest of the galaxy. Due to their limited contact with residents outside the Cluster, Basic was not commonly known to the average Hapan.

==Droids and computers==
[[Droid (robot)|Droid]]s (robots) and computers in Star Wars use either the natural languages or machine languages. [[C-3PO]] is &quot;fluent in over six million forms of communication&quot; and protocol droids are often employed as translators. [[Astromech droid]]s such as [[R2-D2]] communicate through an information-dense language of beeps and whistles known as Binary; devices exist that can translate this language into Basic.  A few non-droids can also learn to understand it through working with the droids for long periods of time, and protocol droids are able to translate Binary into other languages.

==Writing==
[[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] appear throughout the films, mainly on computer displays counting down time or distance. At least one instance of the [[Latin alphabet]] crops up in the original version of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (&quot;POWER – TRACTOR BEAM 12 (SEC. N6)&quot;). Text in the other films is either illegible, offscreen, or in fictional scripts. For the 2004 [[DVD]] release, this writing was changed to the ''Aurebesh'' alphabet. In the novel ''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'', the [[Ssi-ruuk]] speak some sort of [[tonal language]] which involves whistles. A human prisoner devises an orthography for this language.

==Language building==
The languages of some fictional worlds have been worked out in great detail, with grammatical rules and large vocabularies, such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish language]]s, and the [[Klingon language]] of ''[[Star Trek]]''. The fictional languages of ''[[Star Wars]]'', in contrast, are not systematically worked out. The Wookiee growls and the beeps of the astromechs mainly carry emotional indicators for the audience via intonation. The language most often heard in the films, Galactic Basic, is itself identical to modern English (or whatever language the film is shown in), with only a few changed idioms and additions of words related to the Star Wars setting. [[Mando'a]], the language of the [[Mandalorians]], is being developed into a working language by ''Star Wars'' author [[Karen Traviss]].&lt;ref&gt;On her official website, she claims, &quot;Yes, it's true. There's now a Mandalorian language, Mando'a. I developed it for Lucasfilm and now it's a functioning language that you can learn and speak.&quot;  See &quot;[http://www.karentraviss.com/html/newmando.htm Ke jorhaa'ir Mando'a!]&quot; at ''Karen Travis Science Fiction and Fantasy Author''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other languages heard are also human languages, albeit ones likely unfamiliar to most of the audience. In ''A New Hope'', for instance, the language spoken by the character [[Greedo]] in conversation with Han Solo (in the cantina) is actually a simplified version of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], an indigenous language of the Andean region of [[South America]]. In ''Return of the Jedi'', the voice of Lando Calrissian's copilot, Nien Nunb, was provided by a student speaking [[Haya language|Haya]], a language from the young man's native [[Tanzania]] (''Star Wars Insider'' #67, 31). In ''[[Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_The_Return_of_the_Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'', Oola, Jabba's (a name apparently inspired by a [[Russian language|Russian]] word (жаба (zhaba/jaba)) meaning &quot;toad&quot;) twi'lek dancer, can also be heard speaking in [[French language]] saying &quot;''Non, ne me tuez pas!''&quot; (meaning: &quot;''No, don't kill me!''&quot;) as Jabba is about to kill her. One can also hear some [[Finnish language|Finnish]] in ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''. Similarly, &quot;[[Teräs Käsi]]&quot;, the name of a martial art in the Expanded Universe, comes from Finnish and translates as &quot;steel hand.&quot;

The ''Star Wars: Galactic Phrase Book &amp; Travel Guide'' summarizes book and movie information pertaining to Huttese, Bocce, Ewok, Shyriiwook, droid, Jawa, and Gungan.

}}

The expression &quot;'''May the Force be with you'''&quot; has achieved cult status and is symbolic of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' legacy. The line has been said by at least one character in each of the ''Star Wars'' movies. In ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', there are several mentions of the [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]] in reference to [[Luke Skywalker]], by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] (&quot;Use the Force, Luke&quot; and &quot;The Force will be with you, always&quot;) and [[Darth Vader]] (&quot;The Force is strong with this one&quot;). The famous line is actually said by General Dodonna after explaining the Death Star attack plan to the Rebel pilots. It is said again by [[Han Solo]] to Luke, right before the attack on the Death Star battle station. The line is also said by Luke Skywalker at the end of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. A variant, &quot;May the Force be with us&quot; is said by [[Admiral Ackbar]] in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. In the prequel trilogy, the line is said in ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' by [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] to [[Anakin Skywalker]], and also by [[Mace Windu]] and [[Yoda]]. [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] says the line to Anakin in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'', who repeats it back to him. The line is also said between Anakin and Obi-Wan again in ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'', where Mace Windu additionally says &quot;May the Force be with us all&quot;.

In 2005, the line was chosen as number 8 on the [[American Film Institute]] list, [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/quotes.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes |author=[[American Film Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; May 4 is Intergalactic [[Star Wars Day]], taken from the [[pun]] &quot;May the Fourth be with you&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20100508193201/http://www.myfoxchattanooga.com/dpps/entertainment/star-wars-day-may-the-4th-be-with-you-dpgoha-20100504-fc_7371587 | publisher = My Fox Chattanooga | title = Star Wars day: May the 4th be with you | date = May 4, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, during a short address to the Global Citizen Festival at New York’s Central Park, the line was said by [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Narendra Modi]] at the end of his speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/may-the-force-be-with-you-says-modi-new-yorks-central-park/20140928.htm|title=May the force be with you, says Modi@ New York's Central Park|date=28 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/how-are-you-doing-new-york-says-pm-narendra-modi-at-central-park-598883?curl=1411972282|title='How Are You Doing New York,' Says PM Narendra Modi at Central Park|work=NDTV.com|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Star Wars in Tunisia.jpg|thumb|200px|Star Wars filming location in Tunisia]]
The '''Architecture of ''Star Wars''''' includes the cities, buildings, ships, and other structures of the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] as described and depicted in books, movies, comics, and cartoons. ''[[Architects Journal]]'' ranked the top 10, including the [[Death Star]] and the [[Jedi Temple]].&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;&gt;James Pallister [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=5203477 Top 10: The Architecture of Star Wars (pt II)]
15 June 2009 Architects Journal (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the urban and natural environments pictured in ''Star Wars'', Mark Lamster wrote that the cities are places of danger and corruption, while the forces of good find sanctuary in the natural world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambivalent&quot;&gt;Mark Lamster &quot;Evil foes build ever-more-elaborate urban monstrosities- machines not for living but killing, and killing on a grand scale&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=star+wars+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20architecture&amp;f=false Architecture and film] Star Wars and the City page 6&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes the &quot;retro-[[futurist]]&quot; cities in the series as being in between those extremes and places  of &quot;great beauty but dubious moral character.&quot; He attributes the ambivalence towards urbanity to series creator [[George Lucas]]' own feelings about cities and urban environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ambivalent&quot;/&gt;
 
The settings of the movie have generally been praised, but one author took exception to the &quot;anachronistic period architecture and statuary&quot; of ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'', saying it improperly associated [[third world]] buildings with conceptions of innocence and the primitive in a way that was discriminatory and demeaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;hives&quot;/&gt;

==Planet settings==
[[Luke Skywalker]] is first seen in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' living with his adoptive parents in a &quot;complex of caves and domed structures&quot; on [[Tatooine]], filmed in the [[Tunisia]]n desert town of [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hives&quot;&gt;Mark Lamster [http://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=star+wars+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20architecture&amp;f=false Architecture and film] Wretched Hives: George Lucas and the Ambivalent Architecture of Star Wars page 234&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the first movie was shot in the [[Guatemala]]n [[rain forest]] where a celebration with rebel allies takes place in a caved area (a scene said to be borrowed from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s 1935 [[Nazi]] [[propaganda film]] ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;hives&quot;/&gt;). The exotic locales provide scenery that is unfamiliar to &quot;all but a few experts in non-western architecture&quot;, providing the films with fantastic settings that could still be believable.&lt;ref name=&quot;hives&quot;/&gt;

==Urban planning==
Three architecture and planning students noted that the &quot;latest&quot; (1999) ''Star Wars'' movie ''(The Phantom Menace)'' offered &quot;a variety of urban development options&quot; in a ''[[San Diego Tribune]]'' story headlined &quot;How would you like to live on a Star Wars' world?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmic&quot;&gt;Roger M. Showley &quot;The latest &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie ofers a variety of urban development options according to three architecture and planning students who previewed the film; from left, [Tim Belzman], San Diego State University; Bruce Fallown, Newschool of Architecture; and [David Sin], Woodbury University School of Architecture.&quot; [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/74622433.html?dids=74622433:74622433&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+30%2C+1999&amp;author=Roger+M.+Showley&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=Cosmic+communities+%7C+How+would+you+like+to+live+on+a+%60Star+Wars'+world%3F&amp;pqatl=google Cosmic communities]; How would you like to live on a `Star Wars' world? May 30, 1999 page H.1 San Diego Union&lt;/ref&gt; The article included illustrations of [[Coruscant]] (&quot;completely covered by development&quot; and &quot;surrounded by mile-high skyscrapers&quot;), including views from the [[Jedi]] Council building, and the city of [[Theed]] (inspired by an 18th-century palace near [[Naples|Naples, Italy]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmic&quot;/&gt; On [[Coruscant]], &quot;development extends miles below the surface of the city and up into the clouds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmic&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;urban future&quot; has also been depicted in ''[[Blade Runner]]'' where &quot;the setting is a grimy, crime-ridden [[Los Angeles]] in the 21st century&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmic&quot;/&gt; The architecture of ''Star Wars'' may also have been influenced by [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;hives&quot;/&gt; The designs continued Lucas' work from his first feature film, ''[[THX 1138]]'', which featured a [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], [[George Orwell|Orwellian]] &quot;subteranean world of black-and-white spaces&quot; where the population is subdued with drugs and kept under constant surveillance.&lt;ref name=&quot;hives&quot;/&gt;

==Ships==
The [[battle cruiser]]s featured in ''Star Wars'' have been described as examples of &quot;[[Suprematist]] architecture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ings [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17022875.500-falling-star.html Falling star] 21 April 2001 New Scientist&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real world buildings that mirror ''Star Wars''==
The [[San Francisco Federal Building]] designed by [[Thom Mayne]] has been compared to the [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]] [[Sandcrawler]] featured in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Glenn [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2007/04/architecture_im.html Architecture imitates art?] April 25, 2007 Boston Globe&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ING House|ING headquarters]] building (in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]) has been described as looking like something out of ''Star Wars'' that could &quot;move forward on its legs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jodidio [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ut5V7tVWdJsC&amp;pg=RA1-PT341&amp;dq=star+wars+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20architecture&amp;f=false Architecture now! ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, the [[Trinity College, Dublin]] [[Trinity College Library|Long Room]] Library is thought to be the basis for the [[Jedi]] Academy Library in [[Attack of the Clones]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/ten/2002/1111/starwars.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiseek.com/ireland/news/2002/000238.htm ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lucasfilm Limited v Ainsworth''''' was a 2011 court ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/UKSC_2010_0015_ps.pdf |title=The Supreme Court Press Summary |publisher=Supremecourt.gov.uk |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned an intellectual property dispute over the production of Lucasfilm's Stormtrooper costumes by model maker [[Andrew Ainsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/870603-george-lucas-defeated-by-star-wars-helmet-man-andrew-ainsworth |title=George Lucas defeated by Star Wars helmet man Andrew Ainsworth |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Ainsworth argued that the helmets, which he continues to manufacture and sell, were functional props covered only by design right legislation, as opposed to Lucasfilm's assertion that they were sculptures or art which fall under copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-news/european/the-lucasfilm-empire-strikes-out/article2112181/ |title=The Lucasfilm empire strikes out |publisher=theglobeandmail.com |accessdate=2011-07-31 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design right protection is retained for 15 or 10 years, copyright protection can last considerably longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8665299/Star-Wars-prop-maker-wins-right-to-sell-Stormtrooper-helmets-in-UK.html |title=Star Wars prop maker wins right to sell Stormtrooper helmets in UK |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2011-07-27|accessdate=2011-07-30 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stormtrooper character first appeared in the film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''.  The character was conceived by George Lucas, designed by artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]], sculpted by from Liz Moore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = DeBord | first = Jason | title = Facebook Hosts Ongoing Public Debate Over Original Sculptor Credit for Star Wars Stormtrooper | publisher = OriginalProp.com | date = March 16, 2011 | url = http://www.originalprop.com/blog/2011/03/16/facebook-hosts-ongoing-public-debate-over-original-sculptor-credit-for-star-wars-stormtrooper-andrew-ainsworth-or-liz-moore-brian-muir/ | accessdate = September 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = DeBord | first = Jason | title = Star Wars &quot;Prototype&quot; Stormtrooper Helmets | publisher = OriginalProp.com | date = June 24, 2008 | url = http://www.originalprop.com/blog/2008/06/24/star-wars-prototype-stormtrooper-helmets/ | accessdate = September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally molded from the existing designs by Andrew Ainsworth. Before the case came to court, Ainsworth had sold replica Stormtrooper outfits online for many years causing [[Lucasfilm]] to sue for infringement of copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/UKSC_2010_0015_Judgment.pdf |title=Judgement: Lucasfilm Limited and others (Appellants) v Ainsworth and another (Respondents) |publisher=Supremecourt.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-news/european/the-lucasfilm-empire-strikes-out/article2112181/ |title=The Lucasfilm empire strikes out |publisher=theglobeandmail.com |accessdate=2011-07-31 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ainsworth did not defend the 2006 case in the US courts, and the [[United States District Court]] for the [[Central District of California]] gave summary judgement in favour of Lucasfilm, awarding a [[USD]] $20 million compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Lucasfilm Ltd.

== Court ruling ==
The Supreme Court ruled that the Stormtrooper helmets could not be considered a [[sculpture]] for the purposes of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. On the issue of the justiciability of a foreign copyright claim, the court ruled that providing that there is [[in personam]] jurisdiction over a defendant, an English court does have jurisdiction in this area. On this point, the case was distinguished from ''[[Mozambique rule|British South Africa v Companhia de Mocambique]]'' that expressed the general principle that English courts have no jurisdiction to entertain an action to determine title, where claims applied to foreign intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/UKSC_2010_0015_Judgment.pdf |title=Judgement: Lucasfilm Limited and others (Appellants) v Ainsworth and another (Respondents) |publisher=Supremecourt.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their conclusions on the justiciability question, Lord Walker and Lord Collins stated:&lt;ref&gt;''Lucasfilm v Ainsworth'' [2011] UKSC 39, [105].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|We have come to the firm conclusion that, in the case of a claim for infringement of copyright of the present kind, the claim is one over which the English court has jurisdiction, provided that there is a basis for in personam jurisdiction over the defendant, or, to put it differently, the claim is justiciable. It is clear that much of the underpinning of the [[Mozambique rule|''Moçambique'' rule]] and the decision in [[Potter v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd|''Potter v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd'']] has been eroded. All that is left of the [[Mozambique rule|''Moçambique'' rule]] (except to the extent that it is modified by the Brussels I Regulation) is that there is no jurisdiction in proceedings for infringement of rights in foreign land where the proceedings are “principally concerned with a question of the title, or the right to possession, of that property.”}}

They went on further to state:&lt;ref&gt;''Lucasfilm v Ainsworth'' [2011] UKSC 39, [106].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The basis for what remains of the rule was said by the House of Lords in the [[Mozambique rule|''Moçambique'' case]] to be that controversies should be decided in the country of the situs of the property because the right of granting it was vested in “the ruler of the country” and in the ''Hesperides'' case to be the maintenance of comity and the avoidance of conflict with foreign jurisdictions. It is possible to see how the rationale of the [[Mozambique rule|''Moçambique'' rule]] can be applied to patents, at any rate where questions of validity are involved.}}

[[File:Star Wars Logo.svg|300px|thumb|The ''Star Wars'' logo, as seen in all films]]

The '''''Star Wars'' expanded universe''' (also known as the '''EU'''), encompasses all of the officially licensed, fictional material of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' Saga, outside of the [[Star Wars|six feature films]], [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''The Clone Wars'' film]] and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|series]], and [[Star Wars Rebels|''Rebels'' series]] produced by franchise creator [[George Lucas]]. The [[expanded universe]] includes [[List of Star Wars books|books]], [[List of Star Wars comic books|comic books]], [[List of Star Wars video games|video games]], [[toy]]s, and other assorted media.

On 25 April 2014, following the acquisition of the Star Wars license by [[The Walt Disney Company]], it was announced that all previously released Expanded Universe content would henceforth be completely rebranded, referred to as '''''Star Wars Legends'''''. A new company division, Lucasfilm Story Group, will ensure from now on that all new comics, books, games, and other media are non-contradictory to each other and previous works, and valid to the story being told in the films. Given they are part of the same story, however, content and characters from the ''Legends'' works may reappear in the new &quot;storytelling approach&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page.html|title=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page|work=StarWars.com|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line.html|title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of Star Wars Adult Fiction line|last=StarWars.com|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Development===
The early development of the Expanded Universe was sporadic and unrefined, particularly because there was so little official material for the creators to build on. For example, the &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; is generally considered to have begun with [[Alan Dean Foster]]'s February 1978 ''Star Wars'' spin-off novel, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' (although technically it began with [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Star Wars'' #7 in January 1978). This novel drew inspiration primarily from an early draft of the ''Star Wars'' script and was conceptualized as a possible filmed sequel. Furthermore, while [[George Lucas]] was given sole writing credit for the original ''Star Wars'' novelization, Alan Dean Foster actually ghost-wrote it, contributing heavily to the Universe in the process. While he worked on the novelization, he was given a copy of the working script and a tour of the production.

Much of the early EU material from the early 1980s contained analogies to the real world, rather than embracing the holistic fiction of the ''Star Wars'' films. Much of this material now seems rather detached from the rest of the EU.

A turning point was reached when [[West End Games]] began publishing the ''Star Wars Roleplaying Game'' in 1987. In order for players of the [[Role-playing game|roleplaying game]] to create new adventures, West End Games needed to provide supplemental material describing the ''Star Wars'' universe in previously unknown detail. For example, the [[Aurebesh]] alphabet was originally a random piece of set dressing in ''Return of the Jedi''. Stephen Crane copied those symbols and turned them into a complete and coherent alphabet (which would later be used in the feature films). Developing details like this in a consistent fashion turned West End Games' ''Star Wars'' products into a de facto reference library for the Star Wars universe, to the point where Lucasfilm actually sent copies of the game supplements to other EU developers to use as source material.

Shortly thereafter, in the early 1990s, [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] published Timothy Zahn's [[Thrawn trilogy|''Thrawn'' trilogy]]. Widely publicized as the &quot;sequels which were never made&quot;, Zahn's novels reignited ''Star Wars'' fandom and sparked a revolution in ''Star Wars'' literature. Around this same time, [[Dark Horse Comics]] acquired the ''Star Wars'' license and used it to launch a number of ambitious sequels to the original trilogy, including the popular ''[[Dark Empire]]'' stories.

All this development began to feed back on itself: West End Games was producing roleplaying supplements detailing the material from Dark Horse's comics and Zahn's novels. Novelists and comic creators were using West End Games' supplements as reference material. Sequels to the novels were being published as comics and vice versa. The scope of the Expanded Universe grew at a prodigious rate.
a
To date, the bulk of the Expanded Universe has detailed the ''Star Wars'' universe after the end of ''Return of the Jedi'', as numerous topics, including the rise of the Galactic Empire, the personal histories of [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Emperor [[Palpatine]], and [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|the Clone Wars]] had been declared off limits by George Lucas before the development of the [[Prequel trilogy (Star Wars)|prequel trilogy]].

It was decided in the late 1990s that using the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]] as the [[villain]]s had become repetitive and monotonous. Hence a new threat, the [[Yuuzhan Vong]], was introduced in ''[[The New Jedi Order]]'', more specifically, in the first book of the series, ''[[Vector Prime]]''. ''Vector Prime'' proved controversial, as it marked the first and only time a major character from the films ([[Chewbacca]]) was killed off in an Expanded Universe work.

===The Expanded Universe and the prequels===
Prior to the release of ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'', Lucasfilm specifically prohibited development of the time period before ''A New Hope'' in the Expanded Universe (with the exception of the ''Tales of the Jedi'' series which took place thousands of years before the movies). The release of ''Episode I'', however, created an entirely new storyline for writers to work from.

Since ''The Phantom Menace'' was set in a time of peace, it was hard to invent any kind of threat for the [[hero]]es to fight against. Thus most material that built on ''The Phantom Menace'' was either set before or during the film, rather than after.

''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', on the other hand, introduced another fresh conflict&amp;nbsp;— one which fans had wanted to see for over twenty years. Aside from being explored in comics and novels, the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] would be given their own animated series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', which would serve to lead up to the release of ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. In this series, many battles throughout the galaxy are shown, with the Force shown to seemingly its full extent in fantastic fights, such as [[Mace Windu]] single-handedly destroying a whole droid army, without even using a lightsaber. The first (2004) season of the series concludes by introducing the newest villain, [[General Grievous]], an important character in ''Episode III''. Grievous was also a main player on episodes 21-25, released in 2005 and leading directly to ''Episode III''. Following the release of ''Episode III'', events between the two trilogies are now being elaborated, like the [[Great Jedi Purge]].

In addition to adding new possibilities, the prequel trilogy contradicted a number of statements involving the Clone Wars in existing novels. In Timothy Zahn's ''Thrawn'' trilogy, for example, the dates given for the war were inaccurate. This was since [[retconned]] by explaining that the dates were given using the [[List of Star Wars races (K-O)#Noghri|Noghri]] calendar. Also, the character Admiral Pellaeon makes a specific statement about fighting clones in the Fleet (presumably under the Republic) and that the early clones were &quot;unstable, sometimes spectacularly so.&quot; This completely contradicts the prequels, but was later addressed in Karen Travis's ''Republic Commando'' books by the addition of the Nulls. And again, in book three, ''True Colors'', Pellaeon makes his first chronologically appropriate appearance as a fresh Republic officer. As well, with all six films officially released, more and more ties between the prequel and original trilogy eras are being made. [[Rogue Planet (novel)|''Rogue Planet'']]'s introduction of [[Zonama Sekot]], for example, was both an important tie-in to ''Episode II'' and part of the resolution for the ''New Jedi Order'' series. And ''[[Outbound Flight]]'' linked ''The Phantom Menace'' with several Zahn novels (the ''Thrawn'' trilogy, ''Specter of the Past'', ''Vision of the Future'', and ''Survivor's Quest'').

===Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm===
After Lucasfilm was purchased by The Walt Disney Company on October 30, 2012, it was decided that a sequel trilogy would be made. These movies will not tell stories of the Expanded Universe, and instead be completely original stories. On April 25, 2014, it was revealed that existing EU material would be republished under a new banner, ''Star Wars Legends''. Also, a new line of EU material would be published by Disney Publishing Worldwide, starting with ''Star Wars: A New Dawn'' by [[John Jackson Miller]], a prequel to the upcoming TV show, ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. This would be followed by ''Star Wars: Tarkin'' by James Luceno, ''Star Wars: Heir to the Jedi'' by Kevin Hearne, and ''Star Wars: Lords of the Sith'' by [[Paul S. Kemp]]. To ensure continuity within the Expanded Universe going forth, a close story group has been formed by Lucasfilm to watch over all ''Star Wars'' development.

==Story eras==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dark Times: Parallels]] --&gt;

Unlike the films, which are set over a span over 36 years, the expanded universe takes place over 37,139 years in the ''Star Wars'' universe. The earliest work involving the expanded universe chronologically is the ''[[Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi|Dawn of the Jedi]]'' comic series, whose earliest events take place 37,000 years before the films. The most recent is the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy|Legacy]]'' comic series, which is set at most 139 years after ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]''. The timeline below uses the in-universe BBY dating system, based on the years before and after the [[Battle of Yavin]] featured in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]''. The earliest date in the Expanded Universe as a whole is 13,000,000,000 BBY, which serves as the year the universe was created.

*'''''The Pre-Republic Era'' (13,000,000,000 BBY - 25,053 BBY)
Set before the rise of the Republic and first mentioned in the ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]]'', this era saw the Rakata, a bipedal species from the world of Lehon in the Unknown Regions, establish a galactic empire using the Dark Side of the Force. This era ended with the collapse of their Empire and the establishment of the Galactic Republic in 25,053 BBY.

*'''''The Old Republic'' (25,053 BBY - 1,000 BBY)'''
In this era (set thousands of years before the films), the [[Jedi]] are numerous and rule the galaxy, serving as guardians of peace and justice. The ''Tales of the Jedi'' comics series takes place in this era, chronicling the immense wars fought by the Jedi of old, and the ancient Sith. The [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (series)|''Knights of the Old Republic'' series]] and the MMO; ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' takes place during this time, as well as the ''[[Darth Bane]]'' series. The Sith Era takes place during this time.

*'''''The Rise of the Empire'' (1,000 BBY - 0 BBY)'''
Set in the time around the [[Prequel trilogy (Star Wars)|prequel trilogy]] this era takes place after the seemingly final defeat of the Sith. In the waning years of the Republic, the Senate was rife with corruption and scandal, and saddled with a bureaucracy so immense that effective governing was nearly impossible. The [[Sith]] Lord, [[Darth Sidious]], secretly orchestrated his rise to Supreme Chancellor under the guise of Senator Palpatine and personally engineered the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. He promised to reunite the galaxy under a New Order, and destroyed the majority of the Jedi. ''The Phantom Menace'' takes place in the year 32 BBY, ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''The Clone Wars'' film in 22 BBY, and ''Revenge of the Sith'' in 19 BBY.

*'''''The Rebellion'' (0 BBY - 4 ABY)'''
With the Old Republic gone, an outcry of resistance begins to spread across the galaxy in protest to the new Empire's tyranny. Cells of Rebellion fight back, and the [[Galactic Civil War]] begins. This era begins with the Rebel victory that secured the [[Death Star]] plans, and ends after the death of the Emperor high over the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]. The Rebellion starts to reform itself into a body of government, first as the Alliance to Restore the Republic, and later the New Republic. The [[Original trilogy (Star Wars)|original trilogy]] takes place during this era. Specifically, ''A New Hope'' takes place in 0 BBY, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' in 3 ABY, and ''Return of the Jedi'' in 4 ABY.

*'''''The New Republic'' (4 ABY - 25 ABY)'''
Having defeated the Empire at the [[Battle of Endor]], the [[Rebel Alliance]] must now transform itself from a militant resistance force into a functioning galactic government. As Imperial territory is reclaimed, the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]] suffers growing pains, having to fend off insurrections, Imperial loyalists, and wayward warlords. Also, [[Luke Skywalker]], the last of the Jedi, begins to rebuild the Jedi Order and train new apprentices.

*'''''The New Jedi Order'' (25 ABY - 37 ABY)'''
With the Jedi Knights now over one hundred strong the New Republic has signed a peace treaty with the remains of the Empire. The galaxy is finally enjoying a peaceful respite from decades of war. It's in this era that a horrible alien menace invades the Republic from beyond known space. The [[Yuuzhan Vong]] lay waste to entire worlds in their scourge, as depicted in the novels of ''[[The New Jedi Order]]''. The ''[[Dark Nest]]'' trilogy falls at the end of this era. The mysterious [[Killik]] encroach upon [[Chiss]]-controlled space, inciting a three-way war between the Chiss, the Killik Hive, and the Galactic Alliance, with Jedi falling in on all sides. The [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] is set to begin in this era, though it is unknown if it will also end in this era.

*'''''Legacy'' (37 ABY - 139 ABY)'''
Having reached peace with the Yuuzhan Vong, the newly formed Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (commonly referred to as Galactic Alliance or GA) struggles to keep itself working as a single government. But many threats from inside are joined by a danger that comes from the remains of the Dark Side, that threaten to give rise to a new Sith Lord more powerful than [[Darth Vader]] or [[Emperor Palpatine]]. The new Jedi Order created by Luke Skywalker faces a new era as the heirs of the Skywalker legacy grow up. [[Jacen Solo]] has partnered with a nemesis from Luke Skywalker's past, [[Lumiya]], who has promised him only if he becomes the next Sith Lord will he be able to bring peace to the galaxy. The ''[[Legacy of the Force]]'' novels are set at this time. Following the culmination of the ''Legacy of the Force'' novels, a series titled ''[[Fate of the Jedi]]'' begins, involving Luke as he tries to correct the blemish left on the Jedi Order by Jacen Solo. Much later in this era, as suggested by the title, is the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy|Legacy]]'' comic series. Set one-hundred thirty years after the films, these comics follow the story of [[Cade Skywalker]], a descendant of Luke Skywalker who has to confront a resurrected Galactic Empire under the control of a new Sith Order. Volume 2 follows the adventures of Ania Solo, a descendant of Han Solo as she wanders the galaxy trying to stop the plots of the evil Darth Wredd.

==Works==

===Film, television, and web series===
*'''''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]''''' (1978) was a two-hour television special portraying Chewbacca's return to his home planet of [[Kashyyyk]] to celebrate Life Day with his family. Along with the stars of the original 1977 movie, such TV and music stars as [[Bea Arthur]], [[Art Carney]], and [[Jefferson Airplane|Jefferson Starship]] appeared in plot-related skits and musical numbers.  The ''Holiday Special'' features the first appearance of [[bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett]], in an 11-minute animated sequence, and the first reference to Kashyyyk. The special was extremely infamous, only received one airing, and in later years, Lucas has admitted to being ashamed of it.

*'''''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]''''' (1984) was the first of two films featuring the [[Ewok]]s from ''Return of the Jedi''. In ''Caravan of Courage'', the Ewoks help two children rescue their parents from a giant known as [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Gorax|Gorax]]. This and the next film are notable for having their stories written by Lucas himself; one of his few contributions to non-theatrical ''Star Wars'' productions, other than his obvious sanctioning of them.

*'''''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]''''' (1985). In this second ''Ewok'' film, Wicket, Cindel, and the Ewoks ally with a hermit named Noa to defeat Marauders who attacked their village.

*'''''[[Star Wars: Droids]]''''' (1985–1986) was an animated series following the adventures of C-3PO and R2-D2 between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope''. It featured Anthony Daniels as the voice of C-3PO.

*'''''[[Star Wars: Ewoks]]''''' (1985–1987) was an animated series featuring the adventures of the Ewoks before ''Return of the Jedi'' and the Ewok movies.

*'''''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Padawan Menace]]'''''

*'''''LEGO Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out'''''

*'''''[[Lego Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles]]''''' (2013) is a web series based on the toy, [[Lego Star Wars]], created by the Lego company. Its a prequel to the main series' first movie, Lego Star Wars: The Padawan Menace. Yoda begins by training Padawans but then he feels a disturbance in the Force and rushes off to fight the Dark Side.

*'''''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''''' (2014) is a fully 3D CGI series produced by Lucasfilm Animation set between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope''.

*An untitled '''[[Star Wars live-action TV series|live-action series]]''' set between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope'' has been discussed but is on hold. It is thought to focus on minor characters from the ''Star Wars'' galaxy, with the possibility of [[cameo appearance]]s by some of the main characters.

*'''''[[Star Wars Detours]]''''' is a non-canon animated comedy series featuring characters and situations from throughout the film timeline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starwars.com/fans/media/newseries_announcement/index.html StarWars.com | New Star Wars Animated Series in the Works]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that ''Detours'' would be postponed until a later date as the company furthers development of the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A NEW DIRECTION FOR LUCASFILM ANIMATION|url=http://starwars.com/news/a-new-direction-for-lucasfilm-animation.html|work=Lucasfilm|publisher=Star Wars.com|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and audio drama===
{{See also|Star Wars (radio)}}

A radio adaptation of ''A New Hope'' was first broadcast on [[National Public Radio]] in 1981. The adaptation was written by [[science fiction author]] [[Brian Daley]] and directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]]. It was followed by adaptations of the next two films in the original trilogy: ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi''.

The radio adaptations were notable for including background material probably created by Lucas but not used for the films. [[Mark Hamill]], [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[Billy Dee Williams]] reprised their roles as [[Luke Skywalker]], [[C-3PO]], and [[Lando Calrissian]], respectively; [[John Williams]] composed an original score; and [[Ben Burtt]], who designed the sound for all of the ''Star Wars'' movies, did the same for the radio adaptations.

In 1983, Buena Vista Records released entirely original ''Star Wars'' audio drama, ''Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell''. Like the radio adaptations of the films, ''Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell'' was written by Brian Daley.

For more than a decade, ''Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell'' was the only ''Star Wars'' drama not adapted from a feature film. Then, between 1995 and 1998 more than a half dozen audio dramas were released as audio tapes and CDs. These audio dramas were adapted from Dark Horse comic books, and include: ''Tales of the Jedi'' (1995), ''Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina'' (1995), ''Dark Empire'' (1996), ''Dark Empire II'' (1996), ''Empire's End'' (1997), ''Dark Forces'' (1998), and ''Crimson Empire'' (1998).

Adaptations of the prequel films have not been made at this point.

===Books===
{{See also|List of Star Wars books}}

''Star Wars''-based fiction predates the release of the first movie, with the 1976 novelization of &quot;A New Hope&quot; (ghost-written by [[Alan Dean Foster]] and credited to George Lucas). However, Foster's 1978 novel, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'', was the first Expanded Universe work to be released. Some of the earliest EU material was contributed (in trilogies) by science-fiction writers [[Brian Daley]] (''[[The Han Solo Adventures]]'') and [[L. Neil Smith]] (''[[The Adventures of Lando Calrissian]]'') in 1979 and 1983, respectively. In addition to filling in the time between the movies, this additional content greatly expanded the Star Wars timeline before and after the film series.

''Star Wars'' fiction flourished during the time of the original series (1977–1983), but slowed to a trickle afterwards. In 1991, however, [[Timothy Zahn]]'s celebrated [[the Thrawn trilogy|''Thrawn'' trilogy]] debuted, sparking a new interest in the ''Star Wars'' universe. Since then, several hundred tie-in novels have been published by [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] and [[Random House Publishing|Del Rey]]. The books have covered most key timeframes in the ''Star Wars'' universe, but most works have focused on the time period following ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' and on the events of the Clone Wars. Select books have helped fill in the gaps between the original trilogy movies (e.g., ''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire]]'', ''[[Death Star (novel)|Death Star]]'', ''[[Star Wars Tales|Tales]]'' series).

Other notable books in the series include the ''[[Star Wars: X-wing (book series)|X-wing]]'' series by [[Michael Stackpole|Michael A. Stackpole]] and [[Aaron Allston]], the ''[[The Jedi Academy trilogy|Jedi Academy]]'' trilogy and ''[[Young Jedi Knights]]'' series by [[Kevin J Anderson]], the [[Star Wars Republic Commando Series|''Republic'' and ''Imperial Commando'']] series by [[Karen Traviss]], and the multi-author ''[[The New Jedi Order|New Jedi Order]],'' ''[[Legacy of the Force]]'', and Fate of the Jedi Series.

===Comic books and strips===

[[Marvel Comics]] published ''Star Wars'' comic book series and adaptations from 1977 to 1986. A wide variety of creators worked on this series, including [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[Howard Chaykin]], [[Al Williamson]], [[Carmine Infantino]], [[Gene Day]], [[Walt Simonson]], [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]], [[Chris Claremont]], [[Whilce Portacio]], [[Jo Duffy]], and [[Ron Frenz]].

Serialized ''Star Wars'' comic strips, featuring original material written by [[Roy Thomas]], also appeared in Marvel's late-'70s youth-oriented magazine ''[[Pizzazz (magazine)|Pizzazz]]''. As the earliest of these strips were published before original material began to appear in Marvel's ''Star Wars'' comics (which began by directly adapting the 1977 film) and before publication of ''Splinter of the Mind's Eye'', these strips hold the distinction of being the first ''Star Wars'' material in print that was not adapted from one of the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=June 17, 2011 @ 09:38 AM |url=http://Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/06/17/comic-book-legends-revealed-318/ |title='&amp;#39;'Comic Book Legends Revealed'&amp;#39;' #318 |publisher=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com |date=2011-06-17 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, as part of its [[Star Comics]] line aimed at young children, Marvel also published the short-lived series ''[[Star Wars: Ewoks|Ewoks]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Droids|Droids]]'', based on the two Saturday morning cartoons of the same name.

''Star Wars'' was also a daily [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] from 1979 to 1984. Among the creators were Goodwin, Williamson, and [[Russ Manning]]. Dark Horse has also published the [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] in a collection entitled ''Classic Star Wars''.

In the late 1980s, Marvel announced it would publish a new ''Star Wars'' comic by [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Cam Kennedy]]. However, [[Dark Horse Comics]] published this story&amp;nbsp;— titled &quot;Dark Empire&quot; -instead, when Marvel's license on the Star Wars property lapsed. Dark Horse has gone on to publish a large number of original adventures set in the ''Star Wars'' universe. These include: ''Star Wars Republic'', ''Star Wars Empire'', ''Star Wars Tales'' and ''Star Wars Tales of the Jedi''. Dark Horse has also published the Marvel series in a collection entitled ''Star Wars: A Long Time Ago''. In addition, the company has reprinted several [[Japan]]ese [[manga]]-interpretations of the films, including ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' by Yoshiki Kudo and ''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' by Shin-ichi Hiromoto.

After [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] in 2012, it has been reported that Marvel (which Disney bought in 2009) will once again be distributing Star Wars comics once Dark Horse's contract expires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Star Wars Comics Moving to Marvel?|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/20/star-wars-comics-moving-to-marvel?abthid=50d35fa44cd5f76c6e000003|publisher=IGN|date=December 20, 2012|accessdate=December 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later confirmed on the 3rd of January in 2014 that Marvel will in fact be publishing the Star Wars comics again in 2015, starting with two new ongoing series, ending Dark Horse's publication of the series that began in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Marvel to publish new 'Star Wars' comics in 2015|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/01/03/marvel-comics-star-wars/4305811/|publisher=USA Today|date=January 3, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer and video games===
{{See also|Star Wars computer and video games|List of LucasArts Star Wars games}}

Since 1983, over 120 [[video game]]s have been published bearing the ''Star Wars'' name, beginning with ''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' published for the [[Atari 2600]] by [[Parker Brothers]]. Other early titles include the ''[[Star Wars (video game)|Star Wars]]'' [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game (published by [[JVC]]) and three other titles for the Atari 2600.

[[Atari]] produced [[arcade game]]s based on the original trilogy, beginning with ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'', which were both 'flight sim' style games that used [[vector graphics]]. The third, ''Return of the Jedi'', used more traditional [[raster graphics]].

''Star Wars'' has also opened the way to a myriad of Space-flight simulations that take the space wars of the saga in a more serious manner, teaching the player to fly various ''Star Wars'' universe starfighters like more traditional ''Modern Aircraft'' flight simulators. The first among these were ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing|X-Wing]]'' and its two expansions, ''B-Wing'' and ''Imperial Pursuit'', dealing with the Rebellion's side of the war, taking place in the period right before, and up to, the destruction of the first Death Star. The second was ''[[Star Wars: TIE Fighter|TIE Fighter]]'', dealing with the Empire's starfighters at the time before ''Episode VI''. Both games were released for DOS and Macintosh. ''TIE Fighter'' also had two expansions, &quot;Defender of the Empire&quot; and &quot;Enemies of the Empire&quot;. In addition, both the original ''X-Wing'' and ''TIE Fighter'' games saw two collector's edition releases (one for DOS and another for Windows 9x) which featured enhanced graphics quality and added missions. Newer simulators are also available, with ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance|X-Wing Alliance]]'' in the lead.

The first ''Star Wars'' first person shooter, ''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces|Dark Forces]]'', was introduced by [[LucasArts]] in February 1995. Telling the story of Kyle Katarn, Imperial soldier gone mercenary, the game featured a little over a dozen levels where the player explored various original and familiar settings. Featuring an original and interactive soundtrack by renowned game composer [[Clint Bajakian]] using the [[iMUSE]] sound system, along with state-of-the-art graphics, the game succeeded in capturing many gamers' imaginations. The 1997 sequel, ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]'', was notable for having a few cut scenes which were made up of live-action footage of certain Expanded Universe characters, such as [[Kyle Katarn]].

''[[Rogue Squadron]]'' was a cross-platform title on Nintendo 64 and PC which allowed the player to experience a more arcade-action version of the same gameplay in ''X-Wing'' and ''TIE Fighter''. The game consisted of piloting several different ''Star Wars'' vehicles through missions on planet surfaces and in space. ''Rogue Squadron'' saw two sequels, both on the [[Nintendo]] [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] system.

''[[Star Wars: Rebellion]]'' allowed players to compete in the ''Star Wars'' universe on a larger scale, focusing more on the strategic aspect of handling (or defeating) a rebellion, with resource management and agent-allocation, as well as large-scale conflicts between entire fleets of starships.

''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]]'' by [[BioWare]], ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords|Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]'' by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] are recent additions to the EU, and take place in the Old Republic era, right after the Mandalorian Wars.

Other games are: ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront|Battlefront]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront|Battlefront II]]'', ''Battlefront Renegade Squadron, Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron'', ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds|Galactic Battlegrounds]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando|Republic Commando]]'', ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (video game)|Episode III: The video game]]'', ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|LEGO Star Wars]]'', ''[[Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy|LEGO Star Wars II]]'', ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast|Jedi Outcast]]'', ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy|Jedi Academy]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Galaxies|Star Wars Galaxies]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Empire at War|Empire at War]]''. Also released were ''Rebel Assault'' and ''Rebel Assault II'' which are considered by many to be more interactive movie than actual video game.

On September 16, 2008, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' which bridges the events from ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', to ''Episode IV: A New Hope''. The game centers on Darth Vader's secret apprentice, called Starkiller, who goes out to destroy the last of the Jedi. A sequel, ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2|Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II]]'', was released on October 26, 2010 that follows Starkiller as he attempts to exact revenge on Vader following the events of the first game. Both games received a novelization treatment released alongside them that expands on the events of the game and ties them in to the larger Expanded Universe.

In the fall of 2008, it was announced that ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'' (an [[MMORPG]]) was being developed by [[BioWare]] for the PC, it is intended to be a sequel to the successful ''Knights of the Old Republic'' (''KOTOR'') games, also produced by BioWare. Fans of the series were told to expect ''The Old Republic'' to be ''KOTOR 3'', ''4'', ''5'', ''6'', ''7'', ''8'' and ''9''...alluding to the massive content the game is supposed to be planned to launch with.

===Board and roleplaying games===
In a 1996 game from [[Hasbro]], entitled ''[[Star Wars: The Interactive Video Board Game]]'', which is set during the era of the original trilogy, new live-action scenes were shot of [[Darth Vader]] on the [[Death Star]] around the events of ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]''. The footage was made available on a special [[VHS]] tape, included in the box of the game. When playing the board game, the players could put in the tape, which would play while they were in a game. [[David Prowse]] reprised his role as Vader, and [[James Earl Jones]] returned as the voice of Vader. Some of the original crew for ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' came back to shoot these scenes.
A [[Star Wars (board game)|''Star Wars'' board game]] was also released by [[Ravensburger]] in Germany in 2002.

Several editions of the ''Star Wars'' [[role playing game]]s have been published.

*'''1st Edition''' The 1st edition (a d6 version) was published by [[West End Games]] in 1987.
*'''2nd Edition''' The 2nd edition was published by West End Games in 1992.
*'''2.5th Edition''' The 2.5 edition was published by West End Games in 1996.
*'''3rd Edition''' In late 2000, [[Wizards of the Coast]] released the 3rd edition (a [[d20 System|d20]] version).
*'''3.5th Edition''' In 2002, Wizards of the Coast released the 3.5 edition.
*'''4th Edition''' On June 5, 2007, Wizards introduced a 3rd d20 version of the game (4th RPG game version), dubbed the Saga edition. This edition was updated to include setting information from all six movies in the main series, as well as the events portrayed in the ''New Jedi Order'' novels. In addition to setting updates, the book also included a greatly revised version of the d20 system, adapted to work better with the fast pace and heroic feel of the ''Star Wars'' movies.

[[Bill Slavicsek]] worked on all the editions. He included a conversion table (from the previous d6 versions to the new d20 version) at the end of the 3rd edition that helped ''Star Wars'' RPG players adapt to the new d20 version.

In 2005, [[Hasbro]] developed and released a [[DVD TV Games|DVD TV Game]] based on ''Star Wars'' and utilizing the ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' game-play format.

===Multimedia projects===
*''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire]]'' (1996) was an ambitious multimedia project created by Lucasfilm. Dubbed &quot;a film without a film&quot;, ''Shadows of the Empire'' told the story of the events between ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', and introduced a new villain named [[Prince Xizor]]. Utilizing all previous types of media that have been used to present the Expanded Universe, the project included a novel written by [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]], multiple comic book series, a soundtrack, a video game, concept art, action figures, and the like.

*[[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|The Clone Wars]] (2003–2005, 2008-2014). Using methods similar to the ''Shadows of the Empire'' project, Lucasfilm directed a widespread project to tell the stories of the Clone Wars. This project was made up of a theatrical film, novels, video games, comics, action figures, and two animated television series (described above).

*''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' (2008-2010). Described as &quot;the next chapter in the saga&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Lucasarts.com/games/theforceunleashed/#/ |title=Official Website |publisher=Lucasarts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Force Unleashed'' follows the pattern set by the ''Shadows of the Empire'' and the Clone Wars projects, consisting of several elements commonly associated with the marketing of a feature film, including a video-game, tie-in novel, action figures and a comic series. Along with the upcoming ''Rebels'' television series, it bridges the gap between ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Episode III]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Episode IV]]''.

===Parody===
*''[[Return of the Ewok]]'' (1982) was a 24-minute fictional mockumentary-style movie, focusing on Warwick Davis' decision to become an actor and act as Wicket in ''Return of the Jedi''.

*''R2-D2: Beneath the Dome'' (2002) was a 20-minute mockumentary-style movie, focusing on the &quot;true&quot; story of R2-D2's life. It was made as a fun side-project by some of the crew of ''Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones'', but was later deemed suitable for television and for its own DVD.

===Attractions===
{{Main|Star Tours}}

In 1987, Lucasfilm and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], utilizing the power of [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic|ILM]], teamed up to produce [[Star Tours]], an amusement park simulator ride through the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. It was to be placed in the Tomorrowland section of the park, in the location of the dark ride [[Adventure Thru Inner Space]]. Later on it was decided to be put in Disney studios. The ride is advertised as an opportunity to take a tour to the [[forest moon of Endor]] via the Starship 3000. The ship is controlled by a robot named Rex (voiced by [[Paul Reubens]] of [[Pee Wee Herman]] fame), who is new at giving the tours, and your riding experience is his first time at the controls. Along the way, the rider encounters many mishaps, including run-ins with Imperial [[Star Destroyer]]s, and near collisions with asteroid fields, until their ship finally makes it safely back into the port. A Star Tours II has been announced by George Lucas, to be based on prequel situations, although exactly when it will begin production or its opening date are yet to be confirmed. A limited-run line of action figures is also available exclusively in the Star Tours gift shop, based on droid characters from the ride and the line leading into it.

The ride was closed temporarily in 2010 and renovated under the title ''[[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]]''. The ride reopened in all parks in 2011, while the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] version opened in May 2013.

===Toys===
In addition, many other toys have been made. The ''Star Wars'' toy phenomenon began in 1978 with the original action figures, toy lightsabers and blasters, twelve-inch figures, toy vehicles, and much more products. These toys are known as the vintage ''Star Wars'' toys. Today many of these &quot;vintage&quot; figures are quite rare and hard to find. Many are also worth a lot of money. Recently, a toy line called ''Star Wars: The Original Trilogy Collection'', brought back elements of the original vintage toy line, such as vintage packaging. With the coming of ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|Star Wars: Episode I]]'', [[Lego]] began creating little (and quite large) buildable ''Star Wars'' characters and scenes. Recently, the Lego creators have invented light-up lightsabers for their figures. Lego has even licensed these toys in the ''[[LEGO Star Wars]]'' video game series (mentioned above).

Many types of toys have been made. [[Darth Vader]] helmets and voice changers now inhabit the shelves, usually right next to the Ultimate Lightsaber Kit, which contains parts to design and assemble your own functional lightsaber toy. The term &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; was first used with [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]'s assortments of action figures based on the various ''Star Wars'' novels, comic books, and video games. Previous toys based on novels were sold by [[Galoob]] as &quot;Epic Collections.&quot;

In the late 1990s, ''Star Wars'' toys reached deep into the Halloween and specialty markets where Officially Licensed Star Wars helmets, costumes and collectibles could be purchased easily from online retailers on the internet and from retail chains. ''Star Wars'' fans of all ages could easily purchase like ''Star Wars'' costumes for Halloween and plays from online specialty stores. From lightsabers and blasters to robes and helmets, many of today's costumes and accessories are licensed through Rubies Costume Company of New York and sold through independent and retail chain stores. Likewise, companies such as Hasbro have developed and sold toy weapons, action figures and collectibles from the ''Star Wars'' series.

With the development of the newest ''Star Wars'' [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|CGI movie]] and popular TV series, ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'', even more toys have been developed by introducing new characters and adventures to a younger generation outside of the original ''Star Wars'' series.

In 2014, the [[Disney Store]] created some controversy by stating they had &quot;no plans for Leia products at Disney Store&quot; alongside the other male Star Wars character merchandise. After the social media hashtag campaign #WeWantLeia, the company changed their mind and promised to include Princess Leia in the store's Star Wars line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = #WeWantLeia? We’re getting her according to Time.com| publisher = ManVsPink.com. | location=  |url = http://manvspink.com/2014/06/05/wewantleia-were-getting-her-according-to-time-com// | date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuity and canonicity==
{{Main|Star Wars canon}}

The Expanded Universe was intended to be a continuation, and an expansion, on the six ''Star Wars'' theatrical films produced by George Lucas from 1977–2005. All EU material, combined with that presented in the films is meant to function as a complete story. However, to allow this story to function as a whole, it must be kept under in an order of continuity. Lucasfilm holds this of such high importance that a teams' sole job at Lucasfilm is maintaining continuity between Lucas's films, and the EU, which is written by many other authors and artists, many times out of order, and with many different ideas. Lucas, however, was free to go in any direction he wishes in his films to tell the story he intends. He acknowledges and supports the works of the EU but tells the stories he wants to tell in the six films. When asked in an interview his general opinion on the EU, he replied:

:''I don't read that stuff. I haven't read any of the novels. I don't know anything about that world. That's a different world than my world. But I do try to keep it consistent. The way I do it now is they have a Star Wars Encyclopedia. So if I come up with a name or something else, I look it up and see if it has already been used. When I said [other people] could make their own Star Wars stories, we decided that, like [[Star Trek]], we would have two universes: My universe and then this other one. They try to make their universe as consistent with mine as possible, but obviously they get enthusiastic and want to go off in other directions.'' - George Lucas, from an interview in [[Starlog (magazine)|Starlog #337]]

George Lucas has also stated that as far as he was concerned the rule of the Sith ended with the death of Palpatine and freedom and democracy were restored to the galaxy with the Jedi's return, as he symbolized this by including the Senate building and the Jedi temple during the celebratory scenes at the end of ''Return Of The Jedi''. He has stated that although he is aware of EU literature and welcomes its creativity, he has no part in the resurrection of Palpatine and the Yuuzhan Vong invasions (though this would contradict comments by Tom Veitch that it was Lucas himself who suggested they resurrect Palpatine instead of using the original idea of a Vader impostor in the ''Dark Empire'' storyline).

George Lucas retains ultimate creative control over the ''Star Wars'' universe. For example, the &quot;death&quot; of central characters and similar changes in the status quo must first pass his screening before authors are given the go-ahead. In addition, [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm Licensing]] devotes considerable effort to ensure continuity between the works of various authors across multiple companies. Nothing in the Expanded Universe is supposed to contradict the films or any other part of the Expanded Universe. Upon occasion, Lucas's new films, reedited Original Trilogy films, or statements have contradicted existing EU material, and several [[retcon]]s have been used to fix these inconsistencies.

Some purists rejected the Expanded Universe as [[apocrypha]], believing that only the events in the film series were part of the &quot;real&quot; ''Star Wars'' universe. However, elements of the Expanded Universe have been adopted by Lucas for use in the films. For example, the name of planet [[Coruscant]] first appeared in [[Timothy Zahn]]'s novel ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' before being used later in the prequel trilogy (although its pronunciation changed) - though the planet itself, under a different name, had existed in a previous version of the script to ''Return of the Jedi''. Also, the Twi'lek Jedi [[Aayla Secura]] originally appeared in the ongoing Dark Horse Comics series ''Republic'' - apparently Lucas saw the cover which featured her and liked the look of her character so much that he included her in the Jedi battle at the end of ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', played by Lucasfilm employee [[Amy Allen]], and her demise is later shown in the Order 66 Jedi Purge scenes of ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]''. These examples sometimes end up confusing the issue, as they have blurred the lines between the Expanded Universe and &quot;his world&quot;.

There are also minor disputes about what is, and what is not, part of the Expanded Universe. For example, the two ''Star Wars'' spin-off films: ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' were written by [[George Lucas]] and are films, but they are not one of the six main films in the series, so they are usually considered to be a part of the Expanded Universe. It has since been clarified that everything that is not one of the nine main ''Star Wars'' films, any television show after and including ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'', and all theatrical ''Star Wars'' spin-off films, is part of the Expanded Universe.

===Official levels of canon===
Lucasfilms considers primary canon to be only the nine live action movies, ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', since George Lucas worked on them directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/news/lucasfilm-unveils-plans-star-wars-expanded-universe-050000805.html|last=McMilian|first=Grame|title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for 'Star Wars' Expanded Universe|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=Yahoo Movies|date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holocron is an internal database maintained by Lucas Licensing for the express purpose of trying to maintain continuity within all licensed products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/100462-how-disney-bought-lucasfilm-and-its-plans-for-star-wars|title=How Disney Bought Lucasfilm—and Its Plans for 'Star Wars'|last=Leonard|first=Devin|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holocron was originally sorted into four levels of canon, reflecting LFL's canon and continuity policies: G, C, S, and N. A fifth level, T, was recently instituted and comprises the CGI series ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' and the untitled live action Star Wars television series which has yet to begin any form of production. See the article on Star Wars canon for greater detail.

*'''G''' (George Lucas) canon is absolute canon. This category includes the final releases of the six films, the novelizations of the films, the [[Star Wars (radio)|radio dramas]] based on the films, the film scripts, and any material found in any other source (published or not) that comes directly from George Lucas himself. '''G''' canon outranks all other forms of canon.
*'''T''' (Television) canon, which comprises ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. This level of canon is considered to take precedence over C canon (see below), possibly due to the fact that George Lucas is directly involved with these shows as executive producer, and in the case of ''The Clone Wars'' is also on the writing team. This level does not include any series before and including the [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] ''Clone Wars'' series.
*'''C''' (continuity) canon refers to the main body of EU work, and is the next most authoritative level of canon. All material published under the Star Wars label that doesn't fall into either '''G''', '''T''', '''S''', or '''N''' canon is '''C''' canon and is considered authoritative as long as it isn't contradicted by '''G''' or ''T'' canon.
*'''S''' (secondary) canon refers to older, less accurate, or less coherent EU works, which are immediately overwritten by anything in the main continuity of '''G''' and '''C''' canon, but are fully canon whenever they do not contradict something of higher canon. For example, this includes the popular [[Star Tours]] attraction, the MMORPG game ''[[Star Wars: Galaxies|Star Wars Galaxies]]'', and certain elements of a few N-canon stories.
*'''N''' continuity material is also known as &quot;non-canon&quot; or &quot;non-continuity&quot; material. [[Lego Star Wars]], &quot;what-if&quot; stories (such as those published under the Infinities label) and anything else that cannot at all fit into continuity is placed into this category. '''N''' canon is the only level that is truly non-canon.
*'''D'''  (Detours) canon refers to the canon of the animated parody television series ''[[Star Wars Detours]]''. Despite being completely distinguishable from '''N''' canon, it is still completely non-canon. '''D''' canon is typically also classified separate from the other forms of canon

===Lucas's use of the Expanded Universe===
C-canon elements from licensed creators have been known to appear in Lucas' films. Most of these are brief, cameo appearances, almost taking the form of [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] (which may have been added by animators or others under Lucas, rather than specifically dictated), but others are more substantial:

*[[Boba Fett]], originally introduced as a villain in ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', was created for ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and quickly became one of the most popular ''Star Wars'' characters. He went on to appear in ''Return of the Jedi'' and ''Attack of the Clones'', ultimately we witness the first on screen camera time of the adult Boba Fett in ''Star Wars: A New Hope, Special Edition'' in the scene where Jabba the Hutt and Han Solo interact in Dock Bay 94 on Tatooine.
*The name &quot;[[Coruscant]]&quot; was originally used by [[Timothy Zahn]] in the ''[[The Thrawn trilogy|Thrawn trilogy]]'' of novels. Lucas was going to include the capital world of Had Abbadon in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'', but adopted Zahn's name for Imperial Center when presenting the planet in the Special Edition and prequel movies.
*Swoop bikes, originally introduced in the Brian Daley novel ''[[Han Solo's Revenge]]'' and seen in ''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire]]'', were featured in a scene added to the Special Edition of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]''. In the sequence introducing [[Mos Eisley]], a swoop bike scares a ronto. Anakin Skywalker also pilots one of these type swoops during his search for his mother in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]''.
*[[Quinlan Vos]]. Vos briefly appeared as a background extra on Tatooine, in ''The Phantom Menace'' at a [[List of Star Wars cities#Mos Espa|Mos Espa]] café. His character and story was later elaborated upon in the EU. A cameo appearance of this character was witnessed in ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]'' when you see a tank open fire on him and his &quot;supposed&quot; demise. His name (as &quot;Master Vos&quot;) was also mentioned in the film, however, by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in the Jedi briefing room in the Jedi Temple.
*[[Aayla Secura]]. Appeared as a significant, albeit minor, character in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]''. She is the second victim of Order 66, as seen in ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''
*The ''[[Outrider (Star Wars)|Outrider]]'' and with it, the [[YT-2400]] freighters in general. It has a minor cameo, seen from a distance, lifting off from [[Mos Eisley]], in the special scenes added to ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' for the special edition.
*[[Action VI Transport]]s, initially appeared as the ''[[Wild Karrde]]'' in ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'', they also arrive at the Theed Spaceport in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]''.
*[[Prince Xizor]]. Cameo appearance in ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' on a Coruscant landing pad. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Also, a [[Micro Machines]] model of the ''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|Shadows of the Empire]]'' villain was used to populate the spectator stands at the [[List of Star Wars cities#Mos Espa|Mos Espa]] Arena in ''The Phantom Menace''.
*The Force Speed ability, first created for the [[West End Games]] ''Star Wars Roleplaying Game''. Used in ''The Phantom Menace'' by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to evade [[Battle droid#Droideka|droidekas]].
*The planet Tund, first mentioned in the ''Adventures of Lando Calrissian'' series of books, was identified as the planet Ben Quadinaros was from in ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''.
*The planet [[Rishi]], introduced in ''[[Dark Force Rising]]'', was given a mention via the Rishi Maze in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]''.
*[[List of Star Wars Old Republic characters#Alavar, Nee|Nee Alavar]], a background character in ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', was identified as a Lorrdian. The Lorrdian people first appeared in the novel ''Han Solo's Revenge''.
*The double bladed lightsaber (which [[Darth Maul]] uses in ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'') was first used by Sith Lord [[Exar Kun]] in the ''[[Tales of the Jedi]]'' comic book series.
*The name of the Wookiee home planet [[Kashyyyk]] first appeared in the ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', although Lucas himself invented the species and the planet.
*Though originally developed for the Special Edition of ''A New Hope'', the [[Sentinel-class landing craft]] (also known as the &quot;Imperial landing craft&quot;) made its first appearance in ''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|Shadows of the Empire]]''. This is the craft seen lifting off in ''A New Hope'' when the stormtroopers are roaming Tatooine on the Dewbacks.
*In the novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' (released in 1978), [[C-3PO]] mentions that [[Darth Vader]] knows &quot;all the proper code words and commands&quot; to shut him down. This would make sense, given the revelation in ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' (released in 1999) that Vader himself built 3PO when he was a little boy. Whether Lucas was aware of this when making ''The Phantom Menace'' is unknown.

Lucas has often worked closely with EU creators:

*Lucas wrote the story for ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.
*Lucas wrote the stories for, executive produced, and directed pick-ups and re-shoots for, both of the ''Ewok'' films from the mid-eighties: ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure|Caravan of Courage]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor|The Battle for Endor]]''.
*Lucas is planning to write, direct, and produce part of the upcoming ''[[Star Wars live-action TV series]]''.
*[[James Luceno]]' book ''[[Labyrinth of Evil]]'' is based on background information, provided by Lucas, of what happened right before ''Revenge of the Sith''.
*Lucas also gave [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] information on specific events during the Clone Wars, which Genndy then used in part of the series.
*In writing the novelization of ''The Phantom Menace'', Lucas informed [[Terry Brooks]] of the extensive history of the Sith and Jedi before that time period, so he could include it in his book. For example, the character of [[Darth Bane]] is an original creation of Lucas', and although he did not include information on the character in his films, he informed Terry Brooks of the character to incorporate into the novelization of ''The Phantom Menace''. Lucas also gave Brooks other extensive bits of info of what went on during ''The Phantom Menace''.
*Lucas wrote the prologue for [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]''.
*During the production of the ''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|Shadows of the Empire]]'' multimedia project, Lucas instructed those involved to base the [[Prince Xizor]] character on the [[Wookieepedia:Dashade|Dashade]] species from ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starwars.com/databank/species/dashade/?id=bts]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Lucas has been known to ignore C-canon material when creating his films, even when this material is well-established and central to the EU continuity. This has led some to believe that the C-canon material is not, in fact, closely aligned with Lucas' vision. Examples of these inconsistencies include:

*While in the EU the Republic has been extant for roughly 25,000 years, based on statements made by Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'', in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', [[Palpatine]] says that the Republic has stood for a thousand years. Taken at face value, this would not only delete the majority of the EU's history, but contradict another piece of G-canon as well. Authors invented the Ruusan Reformation, in which the Republic is reorganized following the defeat of the [[Sith]], occurring a thousand years before the movies, to explain, or &quot;[[retcon]],&quot; this statement.
*The deaths of [[Obi-Wan]], [[Yoda]], and [[Anakin Skywalker]] in the original trilogy made it appear that dead Jedi typically disappeared and reappeared as [[Force ghost]]s. ''Revenge of the Sith'' revealed that this is in fact a rare ability only a few Jedi have ever mastered. It is unknown how many Jedi have actually mastered it, but Qui-Gonn appears to have been the first of the most recently known Jedi to do so, and ''Revenge of the Sith'' seems to hint that he in turn trained Yoda and Obi-Wan in the way to perform it. No explanation is given for how Anakin managed to learn it due to the utter lack of contact with Obi-Wan for at least eighteen years between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope'', when Obi-Wan confronted Vader on the Death Star, and had no contact with Yoda after he went into self-imposed exile on Dagobah. It is eventually revealed that he was merely given this ability by his father&amp;nbsp;— the Force&amp;nbsp;— following his redemption as the Chosen One and him becoming a Jedi again.
*[[Boba Fett]]'s origins originally named him as one &quot;Jaster Mereel&quot;, a Journeyman Protector exiled from [[List of Star Wars planets (C-D)#Concord Dawn|Concord Dawn]]. It was later revealed that Jaster Mereel was merely an alias Fett was using when he was exiled. The real Jaster, whose name Boba used as an alias, was [[retcon]]ned into a separate character.
*The Clone Wars as described in Zahn's Thrawn trilogy were, at least in part, a struggle between the Old Republic and an army of insane clones grown and controlled by a number of &quot;clonemasters.&quot; ''Attack of the Clones'' on the other hand, revealed that the Clone Wars were fought between the Old Republic, using clones, and a Separatist movement, using droids. When writing the prequel trilogy, Lucas changed the dates he had originally given Zahn for the Clone Wars, so Zahn's estimate was at least a decade off. This inconsistency was easily [[retcon]]ed however, since it is the [[List of Star Wars races (K-O)#Noghri|Noghri]] who give the former date, and this species was using their own unique dating system.
*In the novelization of ''Return Of the Jedi'', Obi-Wan tells Luke that as an infant he took him to be raised by his brother, Owen. This implies that Owen Lars was originally thought to have been Obi-Wan Kenobi's blood brother and not Anakin Skywalker's step brother. Further evidence of this is shown in the ''Jedi Apprentice'' book series which takes place during Obi-Wan's youth, where at one point he mentions having a brother named Owen. It was later clarified that Owen Lars is indeed Anakin's stepbrother, and Owen Kenobi was retconned as a separate character.
*The novelization of ''Return Of the Jedi'' also states that Luke and Leia's mother died when they were 4-years-old, while in the film series, she dies giving birth to them.

[[George Lucas]]' creation of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga was influenced by certain elements of mythology, philosophy and religion. In particular, the conflict between &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; sides of the [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]] resembles [[Zoroastrianism]], while their close connection recalls the [[yin and yang]] of [[Taoism]]:

{{quote|text=Lucas's dualism may have been modeled on Chinese yin-yang notions in some ways, but it has equal inspiration from the Zoroastrian ethical dualism of good and evil. Both the dark (yin) and the light (yang) are present in the Force (as they are in Tao), but in Star Wars the dark is associated with evil and the light with good; in Taoism no such ethical links are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kraemer |first1=Ross |last2=Cassidy |first2=William |last3=Schwartz |first3=Susan L. |date=2009 |title=Religions Of Star Trek |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FfBJSfmRhm0C&amp;pg=PT53 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0786750227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is therefore an inconsistency in Lucas's ideas between the duality of yin/yang (which should be in balance with each other) and the duality of good/evil (where evil is viewed as wrong).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamilla |first=Nick |editor1-last=Brode |editor1-first=Douglas |editor2-last=Deyneka |editor2-first=Leah |date=2012 |title=Sex, Politics, and Religion in Star Wars: An Anthology |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fHgKDWAZ0SIC&amp;pg=PA156 |chapter=Chapter 12: Defining the Jedi Order |pages=156–157 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=081088514X }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is nevertheless a strong ethical element to ''Star Wars'', which has been linked to that of [[Buddhism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Walter R. |editor1-last=Decker |editor1-first=Kevin S. |editor2-last=Eberl |editor2-first=Jason T. |editor3-last=Irwin |editor3-first=William |date=2013 |title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful than You Can Possibly Imagine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U7VOAiIvMSUC |chapter=Chapter 3: The Far East of ''Star Wars'' |publisher=Open Court |isbn=0812697014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stoicism]]:

{{quote|text=To recap, the virtues the Jedi shares with the Stoic sage are patience, timeliness, deep commitment, seriousness (as opposed to frivolity), calmness (as opposed to anger or euphoria), peacefulness (as opposed to aggression), caution (as opposed to recklessness), benevolence (as opposed to hatred), joy (as opposed to sullenness), passivity (as opposed to agitation), and wisdom. Given all these virtues, Yoda certainly resembles what the ancient Stoics described as the sage—the ideal person who has perfected his reason and achieved complete wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephens |first=William O. |editor1-last=Decker |editor1-first=Kevin S. |editor2-last=Eberl |editor2-first=Jason T. |editor3-last=Irwin |editor3-first=William |date=2013 |title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful than You Can Possibly Imagine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U7VOAiIvMSUC |chapter=Chapter 2: &quot;Stoicism in the stars: Yoda, the Emperor, and the Force |publisher=Open Court |isbn=0812697014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of [[evil]] in ''Star Wars'' also resembles that of [[Manichaeism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkRowlands&quot;/&gt; However, since [[Christianity]] views evil as the absence of good, rather than as something real in itself, the concept of evil in ''Star Wars'' conflicts with that of Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkRowlands&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowlands |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=The Philosopher At The End Of The Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cmwsL2AdE_cC&amp;pg=PT122 |page=214 |publisher=Random House |isbn=1448116678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical aspects of the [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]] in ''Star Wars'' have been compared to [[Qi]] in Chinese and Japanese thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamilla |first=Nick |date=2008 |title=Sword Fighting in the Star Wars Universe: Historical Origins, Style and Philosophy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g23D4YMmdb0C&amp;pg=PA45 |page=45 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0786451793}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Star Wars (film)|the first film]] it is described this way:

{{quote|text=Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode IV&quot;&gt;[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Alec Guinness]]) in ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Connections of the Force to [[Prana]] in Hindu thought have also been suggested, but this has been criticised as a misinterpretation which confuses the [[Paramatman]] with the individual soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosen |first1=Steven J. |authorlink1=Steven J. Rosen |last2=Young | first2=Jonathan |title=The Jedi in the Lotus: Star Wars and the Hindu Tradition |year=2010 |publisher=Arktos |isbn=978-1-907166-11-2 |pages=109–110 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ud9x63jUFu8C&amp;pg=PA109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elstree Studios''' is a generic term which refers to several [[film studio]]s and [[television studio]]s based in or around the towns of [[Borehamwood]] and [[Elstree]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]]. A number of studios have existed in this area since film production began in 1914. Some of those studios no longer exist, but several studios still survive today. They are all owned by different organisations and produce both motion pictures and television programmes. For example, the [[BBC]] has studios in Elstree, named &quot;BBC Elstree Centre&quot;, whereas another company, Elstree Studios Limited, owns a separate site known as &quot;Elstree Studios&quot;. As a result confusion often occurs.

==History and facilities==
Despite being called &quot;Elstree Studios&quot;, only one studio has ever been located in Elstree itself, the remainder residing in the adjacent town of Borehamwood. When the studios were being established, Elstree was significantly larger than Borehamwood. Nowadays, Borehamwood is the larger, but the old names have remained in use.

The [[civil parish]] that contains the town was called &quot;[[Elstree (parish)|Elstree]]&quot;. The local [[railway station]] was originally known as &quot;Elstree&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Butt-Stations|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; (nowadays, it is called &quot;{{stnlnk|Elstree &amp; Borehamwood}}&quot;). The local [[telephone exchange]] was also called &quot;Elstree&quot;.

===Clarendon Road Studios, Borehamwood===

====Early years====
The [[Neptune Film Company]] opened the first studios in Borehamwood in 1914. It contained just a single small windowless stage (the first &quot;dark stage&quot; in England), relying entirely on electricity from a gas-powered generator for lighting.

Production ceased during 1917 and the studio was sold to the [[Ideal Film Company]] who used the site up until 1924.

During 1928, the studio was sold to [[Ludwig Blattner]] who connected it to the electricity mains and introduced a German system of sound recording.

The [[Blattner Studio]] was leased to [[Joe Rock]] Productions during 1934 and two years later it purchased the site. [[Rock Productions]] built four new large stages and began making films including the [[drama film]] ''[[The Edge of the World]]'' (1937), directed by [[Michael Powell]].

The studios were owned by [[British National Films Company]] between 1939 and 1948, although during this period a large portion of the studio was taken over by the [[British government]] for war work.

During 1953, the studios were bought by [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], mainly for television production&lt;ref name=&quot;Buxton1&quot;&gt;Roddy Buxton [http://www.transdiffusion.org/tv/studioone/this_is_elstree_1 &quot;This is Elstree, 1&quot;], Transdiffusion&lt;/ref&gt; (including the ''[[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents]]'' series (1953&amp;ndash;1957) and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''{{when|date=March 2012}}) but were sold to [[Lew Grade]]'s [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in 1958.

====The ATV period====
The original intention of the new owners was to use the facility for production of the affiliated [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] filmed series, and ''[[The Adventures of William Tell]]'' (1958–59) was produced here, but ATV's existing television studios were insufficient for their requirements. A 7.5 acre site on London's South Bank had been purchased, but it was realised that completion of a wholly new complex would be some years in the future, while the need for more studio floor space was urgent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buxton1&quot;/&gt; As a result, the Clarendon Road centre was re-equipped as an electronic TV complex and most of ATV's live and recorded shows were made there. The series made by the affiliated ITC, such as ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', ''[[Gideon's Way]]'', and ''[[The Prisoner]]'', were shot on {{nowrap|35 mm}} film at the neighbouring studio complexes or elsewhere. In 1966, ATV recorded the first colour TV programme, a charity event in aid of the [[Aberfan disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Barfe [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XHbFLkrXezMC&amp;pg=PT122 ''Turned Out Nice Again: The Story of British Light Entertainment''], London: Atlantic Books, 2008, p.122-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally some ATV programmes were made at the [[Alpha Television|Aplpha studios]] in Aston, Birmingham, but after 1970 programmes such as ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' were made at the new Birmingham studios at the [[Alpha Tower]]. Larger scale productions, including many drama programmes, continued to be recorded at the Elstree facility for the rest of ATV's existence. In the period of their occupation of the Elstree complex, the smaller Studios A and B were used for schools and sitcoms, while Studio C was a drama studio. Studio D, with permanent audience seating, was used for light entertainment programmes&lt;ref&gt;Barfe [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XHbFLkrXezMC&amp;pg=PT108 ''Turned Out Nice Again''], p.108&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ATV [[Morecambe and Wise]] series (''[[Two of a Kind (UK TV series)|Two of a Kind]]'', 1961–68) and ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (1976–81).&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jay Jones [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4eVrAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT126 ''Jim Henson: The Biography'', London: Random House, 2013, p.126]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The BBC period====
When ATV was restructured as [[Central Independent Television]] in 1982, one of the conditions of their licence renewal by the governing body of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]], was that ATV should leave any [[London]]-centric facilities and become more focused on the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], the part of the United Kingdom that they broadcast ITV programmes to. They remained in operation by Central up until July 1983 (the final production under Central ownership being a [[Max Bygraves]]-era episode of ''[[Family Fortunes]]''), when its new main production centre in [[Nottingham]] was completed. When the [[BBC]] bought the Elstree site in 1984 to produce their new soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' (first aired on 19 February 1985), it did not purchase the equipment within the building. As a consequence, studio technicians were instructed to make the equipment inoperable. When the BBC moved in it repaired the less-damaged equipment, sometimes using spare parts from the same pieces of equipment that the [[BBC]] inherited. The [[EMI 2001]] television cameras used in studios 3 and 4 at [[BBC Television Centre]], [[Shepherd's Bush]], were moved into the newly renamed &quot;BBC Elstree Centre&quot;, along with ATV/Central's old EMI 2001s that were repairable. Meanwhile, the BBC replaced the BBC Television Centre studio 3 and 4 cameras with [[Link 125]] tube cameras. Elstree kept the EMI 2001s up until 1991. Elstree's first new cameras were to be [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] TTV-1531s, one of the last [[Video camera tube#Plumbicon|plumbicon]]-tubed cameras to be made - being replaced in the mid-1990s with Thomson TTV-1542 and TTV-1647 lightweight cameras using, the then-new camera technology of [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]]. Widescreen was introduced in 1999 using Philips/Thomson LDK 100s.

In addition to ''EastEnders'',  many other programmes have been made there including ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'', ''[[You Rang, M'Lord?]]'', ''[[Grange Hill]]'', ''[[Hangar 17]]'' and ''[[Holby City]]''.

In early 2014, the BBC announced their intention to rebuild the ''Eastenders'' set on the existing site. A letter to local residents stated that plans had been submitted to Hertsmere Borough Council and an exhibition and open day for immediate neighbours was held in March 2014.

===Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood===

====British International and Associated British====
[[File:Elstree Studios - Entrance Area.jpg|thumb|right|The Main Gate entrance at Shenley Road (late 1990s).]]
British National Pictures Ltd. purchased {{convert|40|acre}} of land on the south side of Shenley Road and began construction of two large film stages in 1925. After discord among the partners, which by this time included [[Herbert Wilcox]], their solicitor John Maxwell invested and was able to gain control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Warren ''British Film Studios: An Illustrated History'', London: B.T Batsford, 2001, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; The first film produced there was ''[[Madame Pompadour (film)|Madame Pompadour]]'' (1927).

By 1927, Maxwell controlled all the stock, and the company was renamed [[British International Pictures]] (BIP) and the second stage was ready for production in 1928. Maxwell placed [[Alfred Hitchcock]] under contract in a 3 year, 12 picture deal, and after several silents, he was responsible for ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929), the first British [[talkie]] released, which was produced at the studios. At the end of the [[silent film|silent-film]] era, six new sound stages were built; three of these were sold to the [[British &amp; Dominions Film Corporation]] (see below) with BIP retaining the remaining stages. ''[[Elstree Calling]]'' (1930), made by BIP, was reputedly Britain's first musical film.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Duncan [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5yRsKstS03MC&amp;lpg=PA46 ''Alfred Hitchcock: Architect of Anxiety, 1899&amp;ndash;1980''], Taschen, 2003, p.46 ISBN 978-3-8228-1591-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Conrich, Estella Tincknell [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PZS5vb7nQ_UC&amp;lpg=PA32 ''Film's Musical Moments''], Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p.32. ISBN 978-0-7486-2345-7&lt;/ref&gt;

BIP became [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] (ABPC) around 1940 after the death of John Maxwell.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the studios were used by the [[War Office]] for storage.

In 1946, [[Warner Brothers]] acquired a substantial interest in ABPC, appointed a new board and decided to rebuild the stages. This was completed in 1948 and work began on ''Man On The Run'' followed by ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'' starring [[Richard Todd]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].

====EMI and others====
In 1969, [[EMI|Electrical and Musical Industries]] (EMI) finally gained control of ABPC and the studios were renamed EMI-Elstree Studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot;&gt;Warren, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Bryan Forbes]] was appointed head of production of the film studio (see [[EMI Films]]). [[Dennis Barker]], in his obituary of Forbes for ''[[The Guardian]]'', states that &quot;This amounted virtually to an attempt to revive the ailing British film industry by instituting a traditional studio system with a whole slate of films in play.&quot;&lt;ref name=guardian_barker&gt;Barker, D.

Retrieved 9 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Under Forbes's leadership, the studio produced ''[[The Railway Children (1970 film)|The Railway Children]]'' (1970), ''[[The Tales of Beatrix Potter]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Go-Between (film)|The Go-Between]]'' (1971), all successful films.&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;British Film Institute: [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/491680 Profile at screenline.org].

Retrieved 9 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22459886 |title=Stepford Wives film director Bryan Forbes dies aged 86 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography ''A Divided Life'' he states that &quot;They were years of high hopes, of excitement, often of fulfilment and contrary to what various pundits said after the event, the programme proved a commercial success, returning according to the latest [1992] figures a profit in excess of £16,000,000 on a capital outlay of £4,000,000.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Forbes, A Divided Life isbn 0-7493-0884-2 page 108&lt;/ref&gt; During the period 1970-73, when EMI had a short-lived production and distribution deal with the American [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] film company, the facilities were known as the EMI-MGM Elstree Studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot;/&gt;

In 1974, Andrew Mitchell took over from Ian Scott as Managing Director of the studios but was almost immediately told to close the facility and lay off all the staff. Due to the sterling efforts of Mitchell and the help of John Reed who was on the board of EMI and Alan Sapper the head of the ACTT Union, he turned the studios into a Four Wall facility, which effectively meant reducing the staff to administration, with the exception of the Dubbing facility and having freelance crew being brought in by each production company. This was inevitable due to the changing nature of cinematic styles that relied increasingly on location shooting and the reduced financial involvement of EMI in its own film productions, thus rendering a permanent production staff employed full-time at the facility redundant.

Films shot at the facility over the next few years included the [[Agatha Christie]] [[mystery film]] ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974), directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]; [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'' (1977; [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980); [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s  [[drama film]] ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977); and most significantly for the studio's immediate survival through a deal brokered by Andrew Mitchell, [[George Lucas]] with ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977). This led to subsequent Lucas productions such as the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' sequels]] and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchise being made at Elstree and also brought in directors [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jim Henson]]. This was the golden era of the construction picture, which essentially required large studio facilities to fulfill the filmmakers' vision, before [[computer-generated imagery]] technology and Elstree became synonymous with this kind of picture due to the success of the ''Star Wars'' and ''Indiana Jones'' films.
  
In 1979, [[THORN Electrical Industries|Thorn Electrical Industries]] merged with EMI after EMI's debacle with its invention of the Cat Scanner and the studios were renamed Thorn-EMI Elstree Studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot;/&gt;

====Cannon, Brent Walker and later====
The studios were put up for sale in 1985. A management team beat off all other prospective buyers with the help of [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] but the team had difficulty raising their share of the purchase price and Bond took over. Soon afterwards he sold the studios to the [[Cannon Group|Herron-Cannon Group]] in 1986.  In 1988, Cannon sold the studios to the leisure and property company [[Brent Walker]] plc and much of the [[backlot]] was sold off and demolished with a [[Tesco]] superstore being built on the land.

[[File:Stage7.jpg|thumb|left|alt=.|The Elstree Studios facility hosts some historic soundstages.]]
[[File:Elstree Studios Block.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sound stages at Elstree Studios.|Stages at Elstree Studios.]]
A &quot;Save Our Studios&quot; campaign was launched in the 1988 by Managing Director, Andrew Mitchell, local Town Councillor and studio historian Paul Welsh, with the support of many film actors and the general public. [[Hertsmere]] Borough Council stepped in and bought the remaining facilities in February 1996 and appointed a management company, Elstree Film &amp; Television Studios Ltd., to run the studios in 2000. The purchase ended an eight-year struggle that was due to have culminated in [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] action. Brent Walker’s offer to sell the site to the Council, for an undisclosed sum (but no more than its worth as a film studio), represented a victory for the local authority in upholding the planning agreements that protected the studios.

The studios are now most commonly known for being the home of ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]'' and the current location of the [[Big Brother UK]] house (previously at [[Three Mills Studios]] in [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[East End of London|East London]]). The ''Big Brother'' house is actually built on top of the studios' old underwater stage where scenes in ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955) and ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby-Dick]]'' (1956) were filmed. Elstree Film &amp; Television Studios Ltd's lease expired at the end of March 2007.

It was announced in 2012 that the studios would be the temporary home of [[BBC Studios and Post Production]] during the redevelopment of [[Television Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jake Bickerton |url=http://www.televisual.com/news-detail/BBC-Studios-and-Post-Production-to-relocate-to-Elstree-Studios_nid-1892.html |title=News &amp; Comments |publisher=Televisual |date=7 August 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shows such as ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and ''[[Pointless (game show)|Pointless]]'' as well as the ''[[Children in Need]]'' and [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] telethons will be based on the site from spring 2013. The original plan was for the BBC to move back to refurbished Television Centre studios in 2015, however due to delays in the broader redevelopment of the old Television Centre site in July 2014, the lease was extended until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28341537 |title= BBC News - Television Centre return delayed by two years |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=17 July 2014 |accessdate=17 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elstree Studios are operated by Elstree Film Studios Ltd, a company controlled by Hertsmere Borough Council. Feature film production continues alongside television production, commercials and pop promos; recent productions include ''44&quot; Chest'', ''Bright Star'', ''1408'', ''[[Son of Rambow]]'', ''Amazing Grace'', ''The Other Boleyn Girl'', ''[[Notes on a Scandal (film)|Notes on a Scandal]]'', ''Breaking and Entering'', ''Flyboys'', ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'', ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' and ''[[Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old? (UK)|Are You Smarter Than A 10 Year Old?]]'' for Sky television among many others.

===Station Road Studios, Borehamwood===
A single large stage was built in Station Road in 1928 by Whitehall Films Ltd but the company was wound up in 1930. In 1935, Julius Hagen, the owner of [[Twickenham Studios]], bought the site and formed a new company JH Studios.

Financial difficulties forced Hagen to sell the studios to MP Productions in 1937.

During World War II, the studio was used by the government for storage.

In 1950, the site was bought by [[J. Arthur Rank, Baron Rank|J. Arthur Rank]] who renamed it [[Gate Studios]] and made religious films.

Production ceased in 1957 and the site was sold to Andrew Harkness, a manufacturer of cinema screens. Harkness Screens moved out of the site in 2004 having established a global manufacturing base in France and the USA and relocated its UK operation to a new production facility in Stevenage.  The building in Borehamwood was demolished in 2006 to make way for apartments new properties, with the development being named Gate Studios in an homage to the former site.

===British and Dominion Studios, Borehamwood===
[[File:1936-elstree-film-studio-fire.jpg|thumb|256|1936. Fire destroys three stages of British and Dominion Studios. From the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' 15 February 1936]]
In 1930, British and Dominion bought three new sound stages from British International Pictures Ltd on the adjoining site before their construction was completed. [[Alexander Korda]] made one of his greatest successes at the studio, ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (1933), which starred [[Charles Laughton]] as the King. The film's success in the United States and elsewhere persuaded [[United Artists]] and [[Prudential plc|The Prudential]] to invest in Korda's proposed [[Denham Film Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Warren ''British Film Studios: An Illustrated History'', London: B.T. Batsford, 2001, p.26, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Film production continued until 1936 when fire destroyed the three stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DB1kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MHsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=elstree&amp;pg=3532%2C4449867 &quot;British Film Studios at Elstree Destroyed in $2,250,000 Blaze&quot;].  ''[[Calgary Herald|Calgary Daily Herald]]''. 10 February 1936. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; British and Dominion made substantial investment in [[Pinewood Studios]] and moved production to [[Iver Heath]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. The support buildings that remained after the fire were sold off to various companies including Frank Landsdown Ltd, who opened a film vault service. The music stage was bought by the Rank Organisation for the production of documentary films. It later became the headquarters of the film and sound-effect libraries.

===MGM British, Borehamwood===
Amalgamated Studios Ltd constructed a large studio on the north side of Elstree Way between 1935 and 1937, but their plans collapsed and the facility was soon sold to Rank who never used it for making films. After a brief period owned by [[Prudential plc|the Prudential]], the studios were purchased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) in 1947 and was renamed [[MGM-British Studios]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot;/&gt; After improvements the studio contained seven stages totalling over {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|-3}} of floor space. The studios were not exclusively used by MGM, but were leased to other companies as well. These included the [[20th Century Fox]] produced ''[[The Inn of the Sixth Happiness]]'' (1958), for which a large set of a Chinese town, complete with artificial lakes, covering some 500,000 square feet was constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

Several stages were taken up with the sets for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) over its extended production schedule, and indeed [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film is sometimes blamed for making the studios financially unviable. The facility continued to be utilised until 1970 when MGM closed the studios. The American company formed a short-lived deal with EMI, while the site of their former studios was redeveloped for industrial use and housing.

===Danziger Studios, Elstree===
In 1956 the Danziger brothers converted a wartime plane engine testing factory into a studio they called New Elstree,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vahimagi&quot;&gt;Tise Vahimagi [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/773807/index.html &quot;Danzigers, The&quot;], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; which was located to the west of the [[Aldenham]] reservoir. It was used mainly for television production and second features, but was closed by 1962 and sold in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vahimagi&quot;/&gt;

===Millennium Studios, Elstree Way, Borehamwood===
Established in 1993, the Millennium Studios on the south side of Elstree Way offered television and film production space together with associated services. Millennium Studios have now relocated to [[Thurleigh]] near [[Bedford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millenniumstudios.co.uk].  Millennium Studios.  8 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Star wars Characters.jpg|thumb|right|Imperial Troops invade [[Riverbend Music Center]] ([[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]).]]
[[George Lucas]]' multi-film [[Star Wars]] saga has had a significant impact on modern American [[popular culture]]. ''Star Wars'' references are deeply embedded in popular culture;&lt;ref name=Brooker&gt;[[Will Brooker|Brooker, Will]], 2002, ''Using the Force: Creativity, Community, and Star Wars Fans'', ISBN 0-8264-5287-6.&lt;/ref&gt; references to the main characters and themes of ''Star Wars'' are casually made in many [[English language|English]]-speaking countries with the assumption that others will understand the reference. [[Darth Vader]] has become an iconic villain. Phrases like &quot;evil empire&quot; and &quot;[[May the Force be with you]]&quot; have become part of the popular lexicon.&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;Caro, Mark, May 8, 2005, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0505080390may08,0,5905863,full.story The power of the dark side], ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''Star Wars'' film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,&lt;ref name=msn&gt;Emerson, Jim, [http://entertainment.msn.com/movies/starwars_2 How 'Star Wars' Shook The World], MSN Movies.&lt;/ref&gt; enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/jan-june05/star_wars_5-19.html Star Wars: Space Saga], May 19, 2005, ''NewsHour with Jim Lehrer''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science fiction]] since the original 1977 ''Star Wars'', particularly in film, has often been influenced by and compared to ''Star Wars''. Sounds, visuals, and even the music from the films have become part of the tapestry of American society. The film also helped launch the science fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and made [[science fiction film]]s a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster genre]].&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;Cook, David A., ''Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970-1979'', History of the American Cinema, V. 9, University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-23265-8.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been parodied in films and short videos, such as [[Spaceballs]].

==Impact on filmmaking==
''Star Wars'' fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films,&lt;ref name=Bigsby&gt;Bigsby, C.W.E., 2006, ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern American Culture'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-84132-1.&lt;/ref&gt; switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and [[irony]] to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before ''Star Wars'', special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Bigsby/&gt; ''Star Wars'' was also important in the movement towards the use of computer initiated imagery in films.&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; The commercial success of ''Star Wars'' created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. There was increased investment in [[special effect]]s. Companies like [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Digital Productions]] were created to provide them. The 1977 ''Star Wars'' pioneered the genre pastiche, where several classic film genres are combined in one film. In ''Star Wars'', the genres were science fiction, the Western, the war film, and the quasi-mystical epic.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Along with [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]], ''Star Wars'' started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable [[Media franchise|franchises]] are important.&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

The holographic video effect associated with ''Star Wars'' served as a technological tool for [[CNN]] during its 2008 Election Night coverage. CNN reporter [[Jessica Yellin]] and musician [[will.i.am]] looked as though they were in the network's [[New York City]] studios talking face-to-face with hosts [[Anderson Cooper]] and [[Wolf Blitzer]], when in reality, they were in [[Chicago]] at [[Barack Obama]]'s rally. The process involved Yellin and will.i.am standing in front of a blue screen in a special tent, while being shot by 35 HD cameras.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Maureen, Nov. 4, 2008 - [http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/chi-cnn-hologram-081104-story,0,2621692.story The Watcher: Freaky CNN hologram recalls &quot;Star Wars&quot;], ''Chicago Tribune.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, whole films have now been dedicated to the legends, such as [[Family Guy]]'s tribute-spoof season premiere episode called [[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]], in dedication of the saga's 30th anniversary. A sequel to the episode as a parody to ''The Empire Strikes Back'' titled [[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]] aired in the eighth season and another parody [[It's a Trap!]] aired in the ninth season. In the film [[Zack and Miri Make a Porno]], Zack ([[Seth Rogen]]) and Miri ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) decided to make a pornographic film called ''Star Whores'' to get them  of debt.

==Financial impact on Fox==
[[20th Century Fox]] optioned ''Star Wars''. When it unexpectedly became the decade's blockbuster, grossing $100 million in three months, Fox's stock soared from $6 to $25 per share and generated revenues of $1.2 million a day for the studio. Fox purchased the [[Aspen Skiing Company|Aspen skiing]] and [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach golf]] corporations with the increased cash flow and still declared excess profits in 1977. Income from ''Star Wars'' re-releases, sequels, and merchandising enriched the studio in the following decades. ''Star Wars'' helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt [[production company]] to a thriving media conglomerate.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

The [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum]] had an exhibition called &quot;''Star Wars'': The Magic of Myth&quot;. It was an exhibition of original production models, props, costumes, and characters from the first three ''Star Wars'' films.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;Lancaster, Kurt, and Mikotowicz, Thomas J., (editors), ''Performing the Force: Essays on Immersion into Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Environments'', McFarland &amp; Co., ISBN 0-7864-0895-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, NASA launched a [[STS-120|space shuttle]] carrying an original lightsaber into orbit. The prop handle had been used as Luke Skywalker's lightsaber in ''Return of the Jedi''. After spending two weeks in orbit, it was brought back to Earth on November 7, 2007, to be returned to its owner George Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;NASA.gov - [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/behindscenes/Whatsgoingup.html Items Taken Into Space Reflect Accomplishments on Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political impact==
In television commercials, public interest group critics of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] program deridingly referred to the orbital missile defense project as &quot;Star Wars&quot;. [[Lucasfilm]] originally sued to try to enjoin this usage of its trademark, and lost.&lt;ref name=HighFrontier&gt;''Lucasfilm Ltd. v. High Frontier'', 622 F.Supp. 931 (D.D.C. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining its decision, the court said,

{{quote|When politicians, newspapers, and the public generally use the phrase star wars for their convenience, in parody or descriptively to further a communication of their views on SDI, plaintiff has no rights as owner of the mark to prevent this use of STAR WARS. ... Since [[Jonathan Swift]]'s time, creators of fictional worlds have seen their vocabulary for fantasy appropriated to describe reality. Trademark laws regulate unfair competition, not the parallel development of new dictionary meanings in the everyday give and take of human discourse.&lt;ref name=HighFrontier/&gt;}}

On 4 May 1995 during a defence debate&lt;ref name=maythefourth&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1994-05-04/Debate-6.html Hansard, Column 784], May 4, 1994, ''UK Parliament Hansard, Column 784''.&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK parliament, MP [[Harry Cohen]] related the [[Star Wars Day]] joke: &quot;[[May the 4th be with you]]&quot;. ''Star Wars'' also made its mark in the [[Jedi census phenomenon|2001 census]], when over 390,000 UK respondents entered their religion as [[Jediism|Jedi]].

On March 1, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] spoke on the sequestration debate. He said that some people expect him to do a &quot;Jedi [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|mind meld]]&quot; on the Republicans who refuse to deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heil|first=Emily|title=Obama’s ‘Jedi mind meld’ mixes sci-fi worlds|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/post/obamas-jedi-mind-meld-mixes-sci-fi-worlds/2013/03/01/749ca984-8291-11e2-a350-49866afab584_blog.html?hpid=z1|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=28 September 2013|date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on other media==
[[John Williams]]' score for the films, especially the &quot;Main Title&quot; theme and the recurring &quot;[[The Imperial March]]&quot;, has become part of the musical repertoire. Other symphonic themes are often used as fanfares at sporting events.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Along with fan films, there have also been comics based on the series. This includes the web comic, Arc: Clone Files, which involves the stories of a group of clone troopers on Kamino.

[[That '70s Show]] protagonist [[Eric Forman]] is a huge ''Star Wars'' fan.

The characters on [[The Big Bang Theory]] are Star Wars fans.

The Mirage Raceway in Shimmering Flats, south of Kalimdor ([[World of Warcraft]]) is rumored to be a homage to ''Star Wars''' Tatooine planet. Some of the Goblin have a slight resemblance to ''Star Wars'' Pod Racers, also similar is the fact that the course takes place in a desert, similar to the film saga.&lt;ref&gt;http://agencynews.net/2010/02/28/cataclysm-to-have-submarine-s-flats-now-a-lake/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 film [[Fanboys (2009 film)|Fanboys]], produced by [[The Weinstein Company]], takes place in 1998. It is about a group of men who are huge fans of [[Star Wars]]. One of them is diagnosed with [[cancer]] and has only four months to live. The others are worried that he might not live long enough to see [[Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace]], so they decide to put a plan that they plotted since the eighth grade into action. They drive from Ohio to California, break into the [[Skywalker Ranch]] and steal a [[rough cut]] of the film.

In the 2009 Showtime documentary ''Guys and Divas: Battle of the High School Musicals'', which studies high school theater in Southern Indiana and the students involved, one of the students holds up a [[Yoda]] figure and does an impression saying &quot;a great actor Adam is&quot; while moving its lips.

An episode in [[Danny Phantom]], &quot;The Fenton Menace&quot;, was named after ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace''.

The 2010 documentary [[The People vs. George Lucas]] focuses on the franchise and George Lucas.

In July 2013, the producers announced a [[Phineas and Ferb]]/Star Wars crossover which will be used as a sidebar to the events of [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]. The episode first aired in August 2014.

Many celebrities have labeled themselves as Star Wars fans including: [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Seth Green]], [[J.J. Abrams]], among many others.

Some of the mythological underpinnings of the franchise were discussed in a six-part feature on PBS first airing in 1988, called [[The Power of Myth]], consisting of conversations between host [[Bill Moyers]] and renowned scholar [[Joseph Campbell]].

In the 2013 video game [[Grand Theft Auto V]], there is a motorcycle called the Shitzu Vader, an obvious play on [[Darth Vader]].

In 2012, the Holocron was transferred to Lucasfilm's marketing division.

An expanded '''radio dramatization of the original''' '''''[[Star Wars]]''''' '''trilogy''' was produced in 1981, 1983, and 1996. The first two radio series, based on ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', were produced and broadcast by [[National Public Radio]] as part of ''[[NPR Playhouse]]''. A dramatization of ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' was produced by most of the same team and also broadcast on NPR.

The radio serials were made with the full co-operation of [[George Lucas]], who for one dollar each sold the rights to [[KUSC-FM]], the public radio affiliate at his alma mater, the [[University of Southern California]]. Lucas also allowed the use of original sound effects and music from the films.

The adaptations for radio are part of the [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]] within its [[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Expanded Universe]].

==''Star Wars: A New Hope''==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; width:48%;&quot;&gt;
'''''Star Wars: A New Hope''''' is a 13-part (5hr51m) radio serial first broadcast on [[National Public Radio]] in 1981. It was adapted by [[Brian Daley]] from the original film, and directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]], with music by [[John Williams]] and sound design for Lucasfilm by [[Ben Burtt]].

The program expands the storyline by adding a great deal of [[back story]]. Examples include [[Princess Leia]]'s acquisition of the [[Death Star]] schematics; [[Luke Skywalker]] using his binoculars to observe the movie's opening battle and trying to convince his friends at Tosche Station of what he saw; a skyhopper race that results in Luke's vehicle being damaged (seen in the movie in the background of his Tatooine garage); [[Han Solo]]'s encounter with [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s agent, &quot;Heater&quot;; Vader's interrogation of Princess Leia; and Admiral Motti's attempts to convince [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] to leverage the Death Star as a political tool.
All this material was released on tape. 

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; width:48%;&quot;&gt;
The episodes are titled:
# &quot;A Wind to Shake the Stars&quot;
# &quot;Points of Origin&quot;
# &quot;Black Knight, White Princess, and Pawns&quot;
# &quot;While Giants Mark Time&quot;
# &quot;Jedi that Was, Jedi To Be&quot;
# &quot;The Millennium Falcon Deal&quot;
# &quot;The Han Solo Solution&quot;

It was recorded in 1981 at [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in West Hollywood, California.&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Brian. ''Star Wars : The Original Radio Drama'', Mass-market paperback/Titan Books Ltd., 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the series was re-issued on NPR several years later, it was retitled '''''The''' New Hope'' (as opposed to the official alternate title, '''''A''' New Hope''), keeping in line with the subtitles of the episodes of the original trilogy films.

==''Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back''==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; width:48%;&quot;&gt;
The success of the first series led to a 10-part, four hour 15 minute series based on ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', again written by Daley and directed by Madden. The series debuted on NPR on February 14, 1983.

Like the preceding series, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' expands on the movie's story by incorporating new scenes.  Examples include an Imperial attack on a Rebel convoy set before the film's opening scene and a tense conversation between Solo and Skywalker while the two are stranded in the [[Hoth]] wastelands.

National Public Radio's promoted the series in part by getting [[Craig Claiborne]] to create his version of [[Yoda]]'s [[rootleaf]] recipe, which the [[Jedi Master]] serves Luke in the hut on [[Dagobah]]. The recipe ran in magazines and newspapers across the country.&lt;ref&gt;StarWars.com [http://www.starwars.com/kids/do/crafts/f20081126.html &quot;Yoda's Incredible Herb Stew&quot;]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}, November 27, 2008, Retrieved December 11, 2010.

The supporting cast again included [[David Alan Grier]] and also included [[Sam McMurray]], [[Steven Markle]], [[Stephen D. Newman]], [[John Pielmeier]], [[Geoff Pierson|Geoffrey Pierson]], [[Gary Tacon]], and [[Jerry Zaks]].

It was recorded in 1982 at A&amp;R Studios, New York City.&lt;ref&gt; Daley, Brian.  ''Empire Strikes Back: The Original Radio Drama'', Mass-market paperback/Titan Books Ltd., 1995, p. 3. &lt;/ref&gt;

==''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi''==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; width:48%;&quot;&gt;
NPR's plans for a ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' radio serial were put on hold when federal funding for NPR was dramatically reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brian-daley.com/BrianDaley-tributes.htm|title=Official website of Brian Daley}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NPR was never the producer of the radio series nor was it ever granted the rights to produce the radio adaptions nor did NPR fund any of the radio productions.  Plans for a &quot;Jedi&quot; radio adaptation fell apart in the 1980s due to a disagreement (believed to be financial) between KUSC, Los Angeles (the producer of the two previous radio adaptations and to whom the rights were granted for production) and Lucasfilm. NPR was granted limited rights to air the two previous radio series because KUSC, Los Angeles provided the radio adaptations to NPR as part of NPR's National Program Service that allows any NPR member station rights to air the series as part of the annual dues already paid (rather than the 3rd party Extended Program Service where KUSC could have charged each station a fee for rights to air cutting out NPR).  It was not until 1996 that a six-part adaptation of ''Return of the Jedi'' was made by [[Highbridge Audio]], the company that had released the first two series on tape and CD.

Like the preceding series, ''Return of the Jedi'' expanded its story by incorporating new scenes, such as Luke Skywalker's construction of a new [[lightsaber]].  Also introduced in the storyline is a brief appearance of a dancer named Arica in the palace of Jabba the Hutt... a character whose true identity is that of popular Star Wars Expanded Universe character [[Mara Jade]], established to have been present there in the Timothy Zahn-penned novel trilogy starting with &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;.

Scriptwriter [[Brian Daley]] died only hours after recording concluded; &quot;additional material&quot; was contributed by John Whitman, who introduced changes required for continuity with the newly developed plan for the prequels, as well as changes identified by the director and cast. The series was dedicated to Daley's memory.

The show's cast recorded a special &quot;get-well&quot; message for Daley after the author left the studio, unaware that he would never hear it. The message is included as part of the collector's edition box set.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; width:48%;&quot;&gt;

The adaptation used many of the original radio cast, though [[Joshua Fardon]] took over as Luke and [[Arye Gross]] replaced Billy Dee Williams as Lando. [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] was the voice of [[Boba Fett]] and [[Edward Asner]], speaking only in Huttese, voiced [[Jabba the Hutt]].  The only actor who starred in all the [[Star Wars|feature films]] as well as all three radio dramas was [[Anthony Daniels]].

In [[Computer programming|programming]] [[jargon]], '''Yoda conditions''' (also called ''Yoda notation'') is a [[programming style]] where the two parts of an expression are reversed from the typical order in a [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional statement]]. A yoda condition places the constant portion of the expression on the left side of the conditional statement. The name for this programming style is derived from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character named [[Yoda]], who spoke English with non-standard syntax.

Yoda conditions are part of the [[WordPress]] coding standards.&lt;ref&gt;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/#yoda-conditions&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
Usually a conditional statement would be written as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
if ( $value == 52 ) { /* ... */ }
// Reads like: &quot;If the value is equal to 52...&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Yoda conditions describe the same expression, but reversed:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
if ( 52 == $value ) { /* ... */ }
// Reads like: &quot;If 52 equals the value&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The constant is listed first, then the variable being compared to, analogous to the speaking style of Yoda (&quot;Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn|Qui-gon]], more to say, have you?&quot;).

== Advantage ==
Placing the constant value in the expression does not change the behavior of the [[Computer program|program]] (unless the values evaluate to false – see below). With programming languages that use = for assignment rather than for comparison, a possible mistake is to accidentally assign a value instead of writing a conditional statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
if (myNumber = 52) { /* ... */ }
// This equals the new value of myNumber and not the desired condition, and overwrites the value of myNumber
&lt;/source&gt;
Using Yoda conditions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
if (52 = myNumber) { /* ... */ }
// This is a syntax error and will not compile
&lt;/source&gt;

Since 52 is a [[constant (programming)|constant]] and can not be changed, this error will be caught by the [[compiler]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
Boolean myBoolean = true;
if (myBoolean = null) { /* ... */ }
// This causes a NullPointerException in Java Runtime, but legal in compilation.
&lt;/source&gt;

It can also solve some types of unsafe null behavior.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
String myString = null;
if (myString.equals(&quot;foobar&quot;)) { /* ... */ }
// This causes a NullPointerException in Java
&lt;/source&gt;

With Yoda conditions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
String myString = null;
if (&quot;foobar&quot;.equals(myString)) { /* ... */ }
// This is false, as expected
&lt;/source&gt;

== Criticism ==
Critics of Yoda conditions see the lack of readability as a disadvantage that does not outweigh the benefits described above. Some programming languages do not allow variable assignments within conditionals, so this error is impossible to make.

The advantage of avoiding null behavior can also be considered a disadvantage, as null pointer errors can be hidden and only appear much later in the program.

''[[Star Wars]]'', the popular [[space opera]] saga, and cultural [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]], is acknowledged to have been inspired by many sources. These include [[Hinduism]], [[Qigong]], [[Greek philosophy]], [[Greek mythology]], [[History of Rome|Roman history]], [[Roman mythology]], parts of the [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Confucianism]], [[Shintō]], and [[Taoism]], not to mention countless cinematic precursors.

[[George Lucas]] has said that [[chivalry]], [[knighthood]], [[paladin]]ism, and related institutions in [[Feudalism|feudal societies]] inspired some concepts in the ''Star Wars'' movies, most notably the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]]. The work of the mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name=&quot;swmyth&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.films.com/id/11017/The_Mythology_of_Star_Wars_with_George_Lucas_and_Bill_Moyers.htm | title=The Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas and Bill Moyers | publisher=Films Media Group | work=films.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |title=Star Wars @ NASM, Unit 1, Introduction Page |publisher=Nasm.si.edu |date=1999-01-31 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supernatural flow of energy known as [[Force (Star Wars)|The Force]] is believed to have originated from the concept of ''[[prana]]'', or ''[[qi|qi/chi/ki]]'', &quot;the all-pervading vital energy of the universe&quot;.

Amongst the celebratory 30th Anniversary of ''Star Wars'', [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] premiered a 2-hour event covering the entire ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga entitled ''[[Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed]].'' Featuring interviews from the likes of [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Tom Brokaw]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Peter Jackson]], acclaimed [[scholar]]s, and others, the program delved further into the [[Hero]]ic Epic concept and the influences of mythology, and other motifs that were important in making ''Star Wars''. Subjects include [[Ancestral sin|sins of the father]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redeeming the father]], [[coming of age]], [[Interstellar travel in fiction|exiting the ordinary world]], and others.

==Similarities==
&lt;!--Additional examples without references/citations may be removed. --&gt;

===Film===
*''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' includes many elements derived from the 1936 Universal serial ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]''&amp;mdash;the original property George Lucas had sought to license before making the first ''Star Wars'' film&amp;mdash;and its sequel, ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]''. The basic plot involving the infiltration of a megalomaniacal outer-space Emperor's fortress by two heroes disguised in uniforms of soldiers of his army is drawn from ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'', with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo filling the roles of [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Prince Barin]], respectively, and [[Ming the Merciless]] the Emperor. The Emperor's deadly, hostile planet (the [[Death Star]]/[[Mongo (planet)|Mongo]]), a sexy, sometimes scantily-clad brunette space Princess whom the hero defends ([[Princess Leia]]/[[Princess Aura]]), a big, strong, hairy, animal-like ally ([[Chewbacca]]/[[Prince Thun]] of the Lion Men), a fearsome monster found underground and/or fought in an arena by the hero (the Rancor/the Gocko or Orangopoid) a city in the sky ruled by someone who originally works with the villains but later joins the heroes, ray-guns, and dogfighting spaceships were all elements retained from the first Universal Flash Gordon serial. The opening text crawl of Star Wars is in the same style as the text openings of each chapter of the ''Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe'' serial.

*In the [[Akira Kurosawa]] movie ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' that came out 1975, just two years before the first ''Star Wars'' movie, there are two scenes that bear a striking resemblance to scenes in ''Star Wars''. The first is The Captain and Dersu looking out over the horizon, seeing both the setting sun and the rising moon at the same time. This is much like when Luke Skywalker stares out on the sky with binary suns in ''A New Hope''. The other scene is when Dersu and the Captain are suddenly caught in a blizzard, and they have to quickly build a shelter to spend the night, to survive the cold. The Captain collapses from the cold and Dersu has to drag and stuff him in to the shelter. This is similar to the scene in ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' where Han Solo cuts a tauntaun open and stuffs the unconscious Luke into it, when they get caught in a blizzard on the snow planet Hoth.

*The costume for Darth Vader was visually inspired by the character &quot;The Lightning&quot; in the [[Republic Pictures]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Fighting Devil Dogs]]''. The Lightning also had an army of white-armored stormtroopers and flew through the sky in a large triangular airship (the &quot;flying wing&quot;).

*Darth Vader's need to wear his helmet to breathe recalls the oxygen helmets of the underground-dwelling Muranians in the 1935 Mascot serial ''[[The Phantom Empire]]'', which are required by the caped Thunder Riders to be able to breathe on the surface.

*''Star Wars'' was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]''. ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' features the exploits of [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]], whereas the plot of ''The Hidden Fortress'' is told from the point of view of two bickering peasants.  The two peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are first shown escaping a battle, while C-3PO and R2-D2 are first shown fleeing an attack in ''A New Hope''. Additionally, both films feature a battle-tested General – Rokurota Makabe in ''The Hidden Fortress'' and Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''A New Hope'' – who assist a rebellion led by a princess and engage in a duel with a former rival whom they fought years earlier.  Lucas also features many horizontal [[Wipe (transition)|wipe]] scene transitions in ''A New Hope'', a technique used thoroughly by Kurosawa in his films. Similarly, the Princess trades places with a slave girl in ''The Hidden Fortress'', with the slave girl acting as a decoy for the real Princess. In ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'', [[Queen Amidala]] trades places with one of her handmaidens who acts as a decoy.

*''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' features a pod racing action sequence. This entire sequence is inspired by the famous Chariot Race of [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]. The climactic moment when Sebulba's Pod attaches itself to Anakin's Pod mimicks, almost shot for shot, the climactic moment of the scene in Ben Hur when Messala accidentally locks wheels with Ben Hur.

*Lucas has also cited [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' and [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' as references for the style—if not the story—used in the films. A more direct homage to ''Lawrence of Arabia'' occurs in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'', as Padme and Anakin talk while walking around the Theed palace on [[Naboo]]. It was filmed at the Plaza de España in [[Seville, Spain]], which in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' was the site of the British Army headquarters in Cairo, and was shot in the exact manner as the scene in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' where Allenby ([[Jack Hawkins]]) and Dryden ([[Claude Rains]]) discuss whether to give artillery to Lawrence's Arab troops. In the same film, Padme and Anakin also retreat to an estate called Varykino – the name of the Gromeko family estate in ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.  (Some{{who|date=May 2011}} also have considered [[Tom Courtenay]]'s Pasha/Strelnikov character from ''Zhivago'' as an inspiration for Anakin/Darth Vader, but the similarities are likely coincidental.) Similarly, the chase sequence with Zam Wesell on Coruscant likely references ''[[Blade Runner]]''; Lucas based many of the Coruscant cityscapes on Los Angeles in 2019. A reference to ''The Searchers'' occurs in ''A New Hope'', when Luke discovers the burning moisture farm, while the Tusken Raiders sequence in ''Attack of the Clones'' recalls the climax of ''The Searchers''. Han's showdown with Greedo in ''A New Hope'' resembles a scene in another John Ford movie, ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''.

*Lucas is also a fan of [[Sergio Leone]]'s film ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', and according to Leone's biographer, [[Christopher Frayling]], he listened to the score from Leone's film while editing ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Many{{who|date=May 2011}} have considered Vader's first appearance in ''A New Hope'' as being an &quot;homage&quot; to the introduction of [[Henry Fonda]]'s villainous Frank in the Leone film.

* The space battles in ''A New Hope'' were based on filmed [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] [[dog fight|dogfights]].

* The death scene of [[Yoda]] in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' is taken almost shot-for-shot from the death scene of the similarly mystical High Lama in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (Yoda and the High Lama also both share a diminutive form and odd cadence of speech).

* The attack on the &quot;Death Star&quot; in the climax of the film ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' is similar in many respects to the strategy of [[Operation Chastise]] from the 1954 British film, ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''.  Rebel pilots have to fly through a trench while evading enemy fire and drop a single special weapon at a precise distance from the target to destroy the entire base with a single explosion; if one run fails another run must be made by a different pilot. Some scenes from the ''A New Hope'' climax are similar to those in ''The Dam Busters'' and some of the dialogue is nearly identical in the two films. These scenes are also heavily influenced by the action scenes from the fictional wartime film ''[[633 Squadron]]''. That film's finale shows the squadron's planes flying down a deep [[fjord]] while being fired at along the way by anti-aircraft guns lining its sides. George Lucas has stated in interviews that this sequence inspired the 'trench run' sequence in ''A New Hope''{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

* ''A New Hope'' shares at least one similarity with the classic 1942 film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. A [[Fez (hat)|fez]] was placed on [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s head as an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the heavyset Signor Ferrari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002113/bio Sydney Greenstreet – Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The march on the Jedi Temple sequence in ''Revenge of the Sith'' potentially derives from [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s &quot;[[Potemkin Stairs]]&quot; montage in ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|title=Movies Star Wars: Episode 3 – Revenge of the Sith|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/starwars3.html|accessdate=2008-05-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080508031043/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/starwars3.html |archivedate = May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*During Order 66, the slaughter of the Separatists and the declaration of the Galactic Empire are reminiscent of the montage of massacres during the christening scene of ''[[The Godfather]]'', a film directed by his friend and mentor [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. They are similar in the christening of one (the baby and the Empire) with the death of a group of others (the other dons and the Separatists).&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian&quot;/&gt;

*The robot in [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' inspired the look of C-3PO (although C-3PO is golden and male).

===Literature===
&lt;!--In a biography written shortly after Episode IV was released, George Lucas acknowledged the influence of [[science fiction]] literature and particularly the works of [[E. E. Smith|Edward Elmer &quot;E. E. Doc&quot; Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;citation required&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

*The [[science fiction]] writer [[Isaac Asimov]] stated on several occasions that George Lucas's galaxy-wide [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]] bore a close resemblance to the galaxy depicted in Asimov's [[Foundation Series]]. The greatest differences are that Asimov's Galaxy contains almost no robots and no non-human aliens. Asimov addressed both issues directly in the saga's later volumes, most notably ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''. Since Asimov's death in 1992, the ''Star Wars'' cinematic universe has gained new Asimov-esque elements: ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' introduced the planet [[Coruscant]], which bears a close resemblance to Asimov's [[Trantor]] (Coruscant technically originated from ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' by [[Timothy Zahn]], a ''Star Wars'' [[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Expanded Universe]] novel published in 1991).

*In a 2005 interview, George Lucas was asked the origins of the name &quot;Darth Vader&quot;, and replied: &quot;Darth is a variation of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it's basically Dark Father.&quot; (Rolling Stone, June 2, 2005). &quot;Vader&quot; is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for &quot;father&quot; (the Dutch word is instead pronounced &quot;vah-der&quot;), and the [[German language|German]] word for &quot;father&quot; (Vater) is similar. However, in the earliest scripts for ''Star Wars'', the name &quot;Darth Vader&quot; was given to a human Imperial general with no apparent relationships.

*Star Wars borrows heavily from [[Arthurian mythology]] with respect to plot and main character development. [[Luke Skywalker]]'s life and character development parallels that of the legendary [[King Arthur]]. Both characters are orphans that later become heroes in their early adulthood. Both characters also have mentors that are at a much older age and provide them guidance and/or training. Arthur was mentored by [[Merlin]]; whereas Luke was mentored and trained by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] prior to continuing his training and mentor-ship with [[Yoda]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/4407.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/vi/knight_1192/SW/SW_theories/SWAL.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy
 edited by Martha W. Driver, Sid Ray&lt;/ref&gt;

*Star Wars shares many similarities with [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (franchise)|Dune]], including spice smugglers, obese interstellar antagonists and a mystical [[mind control]]-using sect with great influence over galactic politics. The influence was even more distinct in early Star Wars versions, with Princess Leia guarding a shipment of &quot;aura spice&quot; instead of the Death Star plans. The script for [[Jodorowsky's Dune]] was circulating in Hollywood at the time of Lucas' early work on Star Wars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moongadget.com/origins/dune.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/05/20/how-dune-almost-prevented-star-wars-from-ever-being/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/q-a-jodorowskys-dune-explores-690348&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical ===
''See [[Star Wars and History]]''

The [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtroopers]] from the movies share a name with the [[Nazi]] [[stormtrooper]]s (see also [[Sturmabteilung]]). Imperial officers' uniforms also resemble some historical German Army uniforms (see [[Wehrmacht]]) and the political and security officers of the Empire resemble the black clad SS down to the imitation silver death's head insignia on their officer's caps. World War II terms were used for names in ''Star Wars''; examples include the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of [[Kessel (cauldron)|encircled forces]]), Hoth ([[Hermann Hoth]] was a German general who served on the snow laden Eastern Front), and Tatooine ([[Tataouine]] - a province south of Tunis in Tunisia, roughly where Lucas filmed for the planet; Libya was a WWII arena of war). Palpatine being Chancellor before becoming Emperor mirrors [[Adolf Hitler]]'s role as Chancellor before appointing himself Dictator. The [[Great Jedi Purge]] alludes to the events of [[The Holocaust]], the [[Great Purge]], the [[Cultural Revolution]], and the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. In addition, Lucas himself has drawn parallels between Palpatine and his rise to power to historical dictators such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and Adolf Hitler. The final medal awarding scene in ''A New Hope'', however, references Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Star Wars: Attack of the Clones |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020429/story2.html |publisher=[[TIME Magazine]] |date=2002-04-21 |accessdate=2009-12-13|quote=The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's [[Julius Caesar]] or [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] or [[Adolf Hitler]]. Ultimately, the general population goes along with the idea ... That's the issue I've been exploring: how did the Republic turn into the Empire?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans and scholars of '''''[[Star Trek]]''''', owned by [[CBS Television Studios]], and '''''[[Star Wars]]''''', owned by the [[Lucasfilm]] division of [[The Walt Disney Company]], compare the [[Media franchise|franchises']] merits while [[merchandising|merchandisers]] compete to sell rival products.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/business/2005/05/16/cx_de_0516match.html|title=Star Wars Vs. Star Trek|accessdate=2007-09-13 |author=[[David M. Ewalt]]|date=2005-05-18|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media critics and analysts have compared and contrasted the two works in particular because of their great impact and similarities. The franchises are both large bodies of work that make up billions of dollars of [[intellectual property]], providing work and [[entertainment]] for millions of people.&lt;ref name=HC&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=130035|title=Trekkers VS Lucasites|date=May 14, 1999|author=Richard Ho|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
* Star Trek was first introduced as a television series going back to the mid and late 1960s. With the publication of novels, comics, animated series, toys and feature films, it grew into a full scale [[media franchise]]. Before that it was simply a television serial and known only as such that lasted only three seasons.

* Star Wars was first introduced as a feature film in cinema going back to the late 1970s, when the first film, ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', came out in 1977; though a novelization based on the film's earlier script was published a year before the film.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Star Wars quickly grew into a popular media franchise shortly after the release of the first two films and novels.

==Differences==
* ''Star Trek'' has its origin in television and was only known as a television series. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and the adventure stories of [[Horatio Hornblower]] but adopted in the idealistic, [[utopia|utopian]] prospect of future human [[society]]. Star Trek's main focus is giving a fictional depiction of space exploration and the system of a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species. Conflict occasionally occurs.

* ''Star Wars'' is an epic [[space opera]] was inspired by works such as [[Beowulf]] and [[King Arthur]], and the origins of myth and world religions.&lt;ref name=Dreams&gt;''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy''. Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Star Wars is a story that depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, this is not documented in the feature films but can be found in the comics and novels and spin-off films.

==Similarities==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
Aside from having the word 'Star' in their respective titles, the two franchises also share many similarities:

* Both stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in Star Trek consists of various planets, both human and non-human, united into a single state known as the [[United Federation of Planets]]. Star Wars depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the [[Star Wars: The Old Republic|Old Republic]], inhabited by both humans and countless other species, that later became the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and later reformed into a new society called the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]].

* Both franchises promote philosophical and political messages, though Star Wars not as much as Star Trek. The main philosophies of Star Trek convey the ethics of exploration and interference and how to morally deal with a new situation when faced by it. Creator Gene Roddenberry was inspired by stories like ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' that implied a [[morality play|morality tale]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Alexander]], &quot;Star Trek Creator. The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry&quot; and interview with Roddenberry in &quot;Something about the Author&quot; by Gale Research Company and chapter 11 of &quot;Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition&quot; by Richard Keller Simon&lt;/ref&gt; The main philosophical messages in Star Wars are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish one from the other. The philosophy of Star Wars also preaches against the totalitarian system and preaches in favor of societies that give equality to citizens.

* In January 2013, it was announced that [[J. J. Abrams]], director of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009) and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013), had signed on to direct ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Star Wars Episode VII]]'' for [[Walt Disney Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/jj-abrams-set-direct-next-star-wars-film-exclusive-74596 |title=J.J. Abrams Set to Direct Next 'Star Wars' Film (Exclusive) |author=Lucas Shaw |date=2013-01-24 |work=The Wrap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* There have been few actors who appeared in films of both franchises.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Financial comparisons==

==Notable commentaries favoring one franchise over the other==
{{expand-section|date=November 2014}}
* In the book ''Star Wars vs. Star Trek'' [[Tim Russ]] who played [[Tuvok]] on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' argues that while both franchises are spectacular, Star Trek comes out better than Star Wars because it has a setting in humanity's future and can connect with the audience better. Russ further goes to acknowledge that former role as a Star Trek character could be a factor in such judgements.&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars vs. Star Trek By Matt Forbeck&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on one another==
* The two franchises nonetheless have a &quot;symbiotic relationship&quot;, states [[William Shatner]], who credits ''Star Wars'' for the beginning of the [[Star Trek (film franchise)|''Star Trek'' films]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dominguez19990517&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120112134840/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archivedate=2012-01-12 | title=William Shatner's Trek Never Ends The Actor-author Keeps Seeking New Challenges While Feeding Fans' Hunger For All Things Kirk | work=New York Daily News | date=1999-05-17 | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary ''[[Trek Nation]]'' features interviews where both [[George Lucas]] and [[Gene Roddenberry]] praise one another's respective franchises, with the former stating that ''Star Trek'' was an influence while writing the original screenplay for ''Star Wars''.

==Criticism of both franchises==
* Star Wars has been repeatedly criticized by various people for what they see as its violent nature and its mythical portrayal as &quot;a contradiction of religious values&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capalert.com/capreports/starwarsstudy.htm|title=SPECIAL COMPARATIVE STUDY - STAR WARS: ChildCare Action Project (CAP) Media Analysis Report MAR07599|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;decentfilms.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decentfilms.com/articles/starwarsissues|title=Star Wars: Moral and Spiritual Issues|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a two page essay Steve Johnson, a contributor for the [[Chicago Tribune]], gave his perception that &quot;Star Wars is overrated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-31/entertainment/ct-ae-0602-johnson-star-wars-20130531_1_naboo-millennium-falcon-star-wars|title=Star Wars overrated: May the Force be dissipated|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A guest critic on Decent Films Guide raised many issues he feels that Star Wars poses, especially around its growing commerce as well as other issues regarding morality and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;decentfilms.com&quot;/&gt;

He has been critical of the use of pseudoscience in Hollywood and criticized Star Trek for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/tools-toys/the-science-of-pseudoscience|title=The Science of Pseudoscience|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author ''Mark Juddary'' in his book ''Overrated: The 50 Most Overhyped Things in History'' includes Star Trek amongst the list.&lt;ref&gt;Overrated: The 50 Most Overhyped Things in History&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic relief==
* William Shatner was a presenter at George Lucas' AFI Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony. In 2011, ''Star Wars'' actress [[Carrie Fisher]] and Shatner posted a series of humorous YouTube videos [[satire|satirizing]] each other's franchises.

==Future==
Both franchises are set to grow in the next few years.

* Star Trek was rebooted with a series of feature films started in 2009 which was followed by a [[Star Trek: Into Darkness|sequel]] in 2013 and a number of sequels set to follow.

* Star Wars is set to continue by storyline from where ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' left off and is begin aimed to be at least a [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] of films before the decision to make more films has been accepted.

'''Meco''' (real name '''Domenico Monardo'''; born November 29, 1939) is an [[United States|American]] [[record producer]] and [[musician]], as well as the name of a band or production team based around him. Meco is best known for his 1977 [[space disco]] version of the [[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band|''Star Wars'' theme]] from his [[album]] ''[[Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk]]''; both the [[single (music)|single]] and album were [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] in the U.S.

==Biography==
Meco Monardo was born in [[Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania]], to parents of Italian descent, and building model ships, science fiction and movies were some of his boyhood preoccupations. His father played the [[valve trombone]] in a small Italian band, and through him Meco got his first musical education.&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt; Meco wanted to play the drums, but his father convinced him that the trombone was the right instrument, and at nine that was the instrument with which he was to stay. However, for Meco, the [[slide trombone]] was his choice, troublesome as it was for the small-statured boy to extend the slide fully at first. He joined the [[School band#High school bands|high school band]] while still attending elementary school.&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt; At 17, he won a scholarship to the [[Eastman School of Music]] in [[Rochester, New York]],&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt; which provided him with a solid [[classical music|classical]] and [[jazz]] music education. There, together with his two friends [[Chuck Mangione]] and [[Ron Carter]], he started the Eastman School of Music [[jazz band|Jazz Band]]. When he enrolled at [[West Point]], he also played in the Cadet Band.&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt;

Out of the army Meco moved to [[New York City]] and joined [[Kai Winding]]&lt;ref name=billboardbook/&gt; in his four-trombone band, and then from 1965 to 1974 he went on as a [[studio musician]]. Originally not inclined toward pop music, Meco's heart changed when he heard [[Petula Clark]]'s &quot;[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]].&quot; He began doing [[arrangement]]s, for example the [[horn section]] on [[Tommy James]]' &quot;[[Crystal Blue Persuasion]]&quot; and the [[Neil Diamond]] series of [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] commercials. As a [[session musician]] he played the trombone with acts like [[Tommy James]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[David Barretto]]. Although Meco focused on producing in the late 1970s, he contracted the horns and performed on Diana Ross' 1980 album ''[[Diana (album)|Diana]]'' as a favor to producer (and neighbor) [[Nile Rodgers]]. His solo on the single &quot;[[I'm Coming Out]]&quot; is notable because of the rarity of [[trombone]] features on post-big-band era pop records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicgenius.com/DISCOFEVER/disco_profiles/meco/meco_profile.htm Disco Profiles: Meco – The Funk is With Him]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mecologo.png|thumb|right|220px|The uniquely styled Meco logo]]
Around 1973, Meco, [[Tony Bongiovi]], and a third person formed the production company Disco Corporation of America, and, from 1974 to 1976, Meco worked as a record producer. The team of Meco, Bongiovi, Jay Ellis, and [[Harold Wheeler (musician)|Harold Wheeler]] produced the 1974 [[Gloria Gaynor]] hit &quot;[[Never Can Say Goodbye]].&quot; [[Carol Douglas]]' &quot;[[Doctor's Orders (song)|Doctor's Orders]]&quot; was among the other productions of that period.

According to Meco: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When disco was new, it was fresh and exciting because it was different. But pretty soon it became too cookie-cutter and wore itself out.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Meco temporarily left the music industry in 1985. After three years of &quot;doing nothing but playing [[golf]]&quot; he started to work as a [[commodity broker]] in Florida.

==''Star Wars'' theme==
[[File:Mecoband.JPG|thumb|right|The &quot;Sci-Fi Disco Band MECO&quot; in 1977]]
On Wednesday May 25, 1977, Meco watched the [[20th Century-Fox]] soon-to-be blockbuster hit ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' on its opening day. By Thursday night, he had seen the film four more times, and attended several more screenings over the weekend. In the days before cable, computers, video cassettes and DVDs/Blu-rays, other than waiting for it to be broadcast on network television, this was the only way someone could see a movie.

He then got the idea to make a disco version of the score by [[John Williams]] and contacted [[Neil Bogart]] at [[Casablanca Records]] to pitch the project. Only after both the picture itself as well as the original score had become huge hits did Bogart agree to help Meco realize his idea. Contact was established with [[Millennium Records]], then a Casablanca subsidiary, and this became Meco's first record company. Here Meco rejoined with Tony Bongiovi as well as [[Harold Wheeler (musician)|Harold Wheeler]] who had also been part of the team behind &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; in 1974. Lance Quinn was also part of the Meco team, and the different roles played by the four musicians is described by Meco himself in a 1999 interview with his fan Web site: 
{{cquote|Tony and Lance are the two guys who would not let me be &quot;too musical&quot;. Tony would say: &quot;It's not dumb enough—It's too good.&quot; Tony is a frustrated drummer and Lance is a guitar genius, so they would make sure the rhythm section was always &quot;smoking&quot; under the very sophisticated arrangements and concepts that Harold and I started with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.geocities.com/mecofan/?200711 |title= 1999 interview with the Mecofan Page |accessdate=2007-12-11 |format= |work= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mecofan/%3F200711&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:27:40|archivedate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
In a matter of just three weeks they arranged and recorded ''[[Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk]]''. Although the album was nominated for &quot;Best Instrumental Pop performer&quot; in 1977, the award ultimately went to John Williams for the original soundtrack album.

==The band Meco==
For a period of four months there was even a show band assembled to perform to Meco's disco music in public venues. However, the band was not involved in the making of the music. This initiative was organized by Norby Walters, a booking agent for discos. The band members (pictured in this article) toured the U.S. and Canada as a high energy show band called '''Lemon Tree'''. Norby Walters booked and also managed the band before the Star Wars project. Band personnel was Carmine Giovinazzo, Stan Glogicheski, Tommy Rocco, Tony Abruzzo, and Tony &quot;Butch&quot; Gerace.

==Other soundtracks become &quot;Meco-ized&quot;==
In the fall of 1977, Meco's second album was released. It was another rearranged science-fiction movie soundtrack, ''[[Encounters Of Every Kind]]'', based on John Williams music of the movie ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', from which three singles were released: &quot;Topsy,&quot; &quot;Meco's Theme,&quot; and &quot;Theme from ‘Close Encounters.’&quot;

Meco's third album came in early 1978, and this time it was the [[Musical selections in The Wizard of Oz|music from]] ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard Of Oz]]'', which got transformed into a disco album by the same name, as Meco described: &quot;It is my best work, bar none.&quot; From this album came the [[chart-topper|hit single]] &quot;Themes from The Wizard of Oz: ‘Over the Rainbow’/‘We're off to See the Wizard.’&quot;

In the fall of 1978, Millennium merged with [[RCA Records|RCA]]. Since he had developed a deep-bonded working relationship with Neil Bogart and other staff at Casablanca Records (Millennium and Casablanca having cooperated closely), Meco decided to move to Casablanca.

Casablanca released the fourth Meco album, ''Superman &amp; Other Galactic Heroes'', featuring two hit singles, &quot;Superman Theme&quot; and &quot;Love Theme From Superman.&quot; This was yet another Meco makeover of an original John Williams score.

In 1979, the fifth album, ''Moondancer'', was released, and with it the hit singles &quot;Moondancer,&quot; &quot;[[Grazing In The Grass]],&quot; and &quot;Devil's Delight.&quot;

In 1980, Meco's sixth album, ''Music From “Star Trek” &amp; Music from “The Black Hole,”'' was released, featuring the song &quot;Theme From ‘Star Trek.’&quot; The movie ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' ([[1979 in film|1979]]) featured an original soundtrack composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].

The last album that Meco made for Casablanca, his seventh, which came out in 1981, was ''The American Werewolf In London'', based on the soundtrack from the 1981 movie ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]''. After this Meco's tenure with Casablanca was over, and he signed with [[RCA Records]].

'''''Han''''' is a genus of [[agnostid]] [[trilobite]], whose sole member is '''''Han solo''''', a species known only from [[fossil]]s found in the [[Ordovician]] [[Zitai Formation]] of southern [[China]].

==Taxonomy==
This taxon was erected in 2005, based upon fossil material found in beds of lower [[Zitai Formation]] exposed in [[Maocaopu]], [[Reshi]], [[Taoyuan County, Hunan|Taoyuan County]] in north [[Hunan]], [[China]]. Fossil material include a [[cephalon (trilobite anatomy)|cephalon]] and two [[pygidium|pygidia]]. It was found to belong to family [[Diplagnostidae]], subfamily [[Pseudagnostinae]]; it was originally thought to be most closely related to the genus ''[[Pseudorhaptagnostus]]'', but it differed substantially from that genus in both some important diagnostic characters, and in the age of the beds in it was deposited, so a new genus was erected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turvey 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Samuel T. Turvey | year = 2005 | title = Agnostid trilobites from the Arenig–Llanvirn of South China | journal = [[Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]: Earth Sciences | volume = 95 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 527–542 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=1199796 | accessdate = February 9, 2009 | doi = 10.1017/S0263593304000355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
According to the original publication, the generic name ''Han'' is a reference to the [[Han Chinese]], the largest [[ethnic group]] in present-day China; and the specific epithet ''solo'' refers to the fact that the species is the youngest [[Diplagnostidae]] fossil found to that date, suggesting that it was the last surviving member of that family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turvey 2005&quot;/&gt; However, Turvey has stated elsewhere that he named it after [[Han Solo]] because some friends dared him to name a species after a [[Star Wars]] character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curiosities&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/etym/fiction.html | title = Etymology: Names from Fictional Characters | work = Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature | accessdate = February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not the only unusual scientific name erected by Turvey; in the same paper he named a new species of ''[[Geragnostus]]'' ''[[Geragnostus waldorfstatleri|G.&amp;nbsp;waldorfstatleri]]'', because of &quot;the resemblance of the pygidial axis to the heads of [[Waldorf and Statler]], two characters from ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turvey 2005&quot;/&gt; The actor who portrays Han Solo in Star Wars, [[Harrison Ford]], also has a species of spider named for him, ''[[Calponia harrisonfordi]]''. [[Arachnologist]] [[Norman I. Platnick]] named it for him out of thanks for assistance in a museum film production. Other taxa named after Star Wars characters include the [[isopod]] ''[[Albunione yoda]]'', the [[Oribatida|oribatid]] [[mite]] genus ''[[Darthvaderum]]'', the [[wasp]]s ''[[Polemistus chewbacca]]'' and ''[[Polemistus vaderi]]'', and the [[beetle]] ''[[Agathidium vaderi]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curiosities&quot;/&gt;

'''''Star Wars''''' is an American [[epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] franchise centered on a [[film series]] created by [[George Lucas]]. The film series, consisting of two trilogies (and an upcoming third), has spawned an extensive [[media franchise]] called the [[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Expanded Universe]] including [[List of Star Wars books|books]], television series, [[Star Wars video games|computer and video games]], and [[List of Star Wars comic books|comic books]]. These supplements to the franchise resulted in significant development of the series' [[fictional universe]], keeping the franchise active in the 16-year interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as far, far away in the distant past, and it commonly portrays [[Jedi]] as a representation of good, in conflict with the [[Sith]], their evil counterpart. Their weapon of choice, the [[lightsaber]], is commonly recognized in popular culture. The franchise's storylines contain many themes, with strong influences from [[Philosophy and religion in Star Wars|philosophy and religion]].

The first film in the series was originally released on May 25, 1977, under the title ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'',  by [[20th Century Fox]], and became a worldwide [[popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon, followed by two sequels, released at three-year intervals. Sixteen years after the release of the trilogy's final film, the first in a new [[prequel]] trilogy of films was released. The three prequel films were also released at three-year intervals, with the final film of the trilogy released on May 19, 2005. In 2012, [[The Walt Disney Company]] acquired [[Lucasfilm]] for $4.05 billion and announced that it would produce [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|three new films]], with the first film, ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', planned for release in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://money.msn.com/business-news/article.aspx?feed=AP&amp;Date=20121030&amp;ID=15733883 |title= Disney to make new 'Star Wars' films, buy Lucas co | last= Nakashima | first = Ryan |work=MSN Money|date=October 30, 2012|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  20th Century Fox still retains the distribution rights to the first two ''Star Wars'' trilogies, owning permanent rights for the original film ''Episode IV: A New Hope'', while holding the rights to ''Episodes I''–''III'', ''V'', and ''VI'' until May 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOXrights&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tangled-rights-could-tie-up-384541 | title=Tangled Rights Could Tie Up Ultimate 'Star Wars' Box Set (Analysis) | work =The Hollywood Reporter | date=October 30, 2012 | accessdate=November 12, 2012 | last =Masters | first = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions to the original trilogy were positive, with the last film being considered the weakest, while the prequel trilogy received a more mixed reaction, with most of the praise being for the final film, according to most [[review aggregator]] websites. All six of the main films in the series were nominated for or won [[Academy Awards]]. All of the main films have been box office successes, with the overall box office revenue generated by the ''Star Wars'' films (including the theatrical ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'') totalling $4.38&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/StarWars.php | title = Star Wars – Box Office History | work = The numbers | accessdate= June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|fifth-highest-grossing film series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers franchises&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Movie Franchises |work=The Numbers |publisher = Nash Information Services |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/franchisesW.php |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success has also led to multiple re-releases in theaters for the series.

The events depicted in ''Star Wars'' media take place in a [[fictional galaxy]]. Many species of [[List of Star Wars creatures|alien creatures]] (often [[humanoid]]) are depicted. Robotic [[droid (robot)|droids]] are also commonplace and are generally built to serve their owners.  [[Spacefaring|Space travel]] is common, and many planets in the galaxy are members of a [[Galactic Republic]], later reorganized as the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].

One of the prominent elements of ''Star Wars'' is the &quot;[[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]&quot;, an omnipresent energy that can be harnessed by those with that ability, known as Force-sensitives. It is described in the first produced film as &quot;an energy field created by all living things [that] surrounds us, penetrates us, [and] binds the galaxy together.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 4&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2006|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Force allows users to perform various [[supernatural]] feats (such as [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]], [[clairvoyance]], [[precognition]], and [[mind control]]) and can amplify certain physical traits, such as speed and reflexes; these abilities vary between characters and can be improved through training.  While the Force can be used for good, it has a [[Dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]] that, when pursued, imbues users with hatred, aggression, and malevolence. The six films feature the [[Jedi]], who use the Force for good, and the [[Sith]], who use the dark side for evil in an attempt to take over the galaxy. In the [[Star Wars Expanded Universe|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]], many dark side users are [[Dark Jedi]] rather than Sith, mainly because of the &quot;[[Star Wars: Darth Bane: Rule of Two|Rule of Two]]&quot; (see [[Sith#Sith characters|Sith Origin]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 1&quot;&gt;{{Cite video| title= [[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]] | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2001|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 5&quot;&gt;{{Cite video | title =[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2004|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 6&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|title = [[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2004|medium= DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatrical films==
The film series began with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', released on May 25, 1977. This was followed by two sequels: ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', released on May 21, 1980, and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', released on May 25, 1983. The [[Star Wars opening crawl|opening crawl]] of the sequels disclosed that they were numbered as &quot;Episode V&quot; and &quot;Episode VI&quot; respectively, though the films were generally advertised solely under their subtitles. Though the first film in the series was simply titled ''Star Wars'', with its 1981 re-release it had the subtitle ''Episode IV: A New Hope'' added to remain consistent with its sequel, and to establish it as the middle chapter of a continuing saga.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lucas&quot;&gt;{{Cite video| people=Lucas, George|date=2004|title=DVD commentary for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, to correspond with the 20th anniversary of ''A New Hope'', Lucas released a &quot;Special Edition&quot; of the ''Star Wars'' trilogy to theaters. The re-release featured alterations to the three films, primarily motivated by the improvement of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and other special effects technologies, which allowed visuals that were not possible to achieve at the time of the original filmmaking. Lucas continued to [[list of changes in Star Wars re-releases|make changes]] to the films for subsequent releases, such as the first ever [[DVD]] release of the original trilogy on September 21, 2004 and the first ever [[Blu-ray]] release of all six films on September 16, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56847187.html|title=The Force returns: ‘Star Wars' Special Edition features some new tinkering but same old thrills | work= The Washington Times |date= January 26, 1997| last = Arnold | first = Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reception of the ''Special Edition'' was mixed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Utichi|first1=Joe|title=Star Wars on Blu-ray: George, don't do that…|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/aug/19/star-wars-blu-ray-lucas|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=July 27, 2014|date=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Disney Ever Release the original pre-Special Edition Star Wars Movies?|url=http://thestarwarstrilogy.com/starwars/post/2014/02/17/Will-Disney-Ever-Release-the-original-pre-Special-Edition-Star-Wars-Movies|publisher=The Star Wars Trilogy|accessdate=July 27, 2014|date=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope – Comparison: Special Edition, DVD Edition|url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=2601599|publisher=Movie-Censorship.com|accessdate=July 27, 2014|date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Lee|title=Could Disney finally give us the remastered, unedited Star Wars we want?|url=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/05/could-disney-finally-give-us-the-remastered-unedited-star-wars-we-want/|publisher=ARS Technica|accessdate=July 27, 2014|date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting petitions and fan edits to produce restored copies of the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Request to Restore the Theatrical Cuts of the Original Star Wars Trilogy for Blu-ray|url=http://originaltrilogy.com/petition/|publisher=OriginalTrilogy.com|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Philippe|first1=Alexandre O.|url=http://peoplevsgeorge.com/|publisher=The People vs. George Lucas|accessdate=July 27, 2014|title=The People vs. George Lucas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot overview===
[[File:Amsterdam - De Dam - Figure 1 (Darth Vader).JPG|thumb|right|170px|A street performer in costume as [[Darth Vader]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Vader is considered to be one of the most iconic characters of the ''Star Wars'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/star-wars-characters/1.html | title=Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker – #1 Star Wars character | publisher=IGN | accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The original trilogy begins with the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] nearing completion of the [[Death Star]] space station, which will allow the Empire to crush the [[Rebel Alliance]], an organized resistance formed to combat [[Palpatine|Emperor Palpatine]]'s tyranny. Palpatine's Sith apprentice [[Darth Vader]] captures [[Princess Leia]], a member of the rebellion who has stolen the plans to the Death Star and hidden them in the astromech droid [[R2-D2]]. R2, along with his protocol droid counterpart [[C-3PO]], escapes to the desert planet [[Tatooine]]. There, the droids are purchased by farm boy [[Luke Skywalker]] and his step-uncle and aunt. While Luke is cleaning R2, he accidentally triggers a message put into the droid by Leia, who asks for assistance from the legendary Jedi Knight [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Luke later assists the droids in finding the exiled Jedi, who is now passing as an old hermit under the alias Ben Kenobi. When Luke asks about his father, whom he has never met, Obi-Wan tells him that Anakin Skywalker was a great Jedi who was betrayed and murdered by Vader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate= March 29, 2008|url= http://www.ruinedendings.com/film1226plot | title =Star Wars plot summary |publisher=Ruined Endings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obi-Wan and Luke hire the smuggler [[Han Solo]] and his [[Wookiee]] co-pilot [[Chewbacca]] to take them to [[Alderaan]], Leia's home world, which they eventually find has been destroyed by the Death Star. Once on board the space station, Luke and Han rescue Leia while Obi-Wan allows himself to be killed during a [[lightsaber]] duel with Vader; his sacrifice allows the group to escape with the plans that help the Rebels destroy the Death Star. Luke himself (guided by the power of [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]) fires the shot that destroys the deadly space station during the Battle of [[Yavin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 4&quot; /&gt;

Three years later, Luke travels to find the Jedi Master [[Yoda]], now living in exile on the swamp-infested world of [[Dagobah]], to begin his Jedi training. However, Luke's training is interrupted when Vader lures him into a trap by capturing Han and his friends at [[Bespin|Cloud City]]. During a fierce lightsaber duel, Vader reveals that he is Luke's father and attempts to turn him to the dark side of the Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 5&quot;/&gt; Luke escapes and, after rescuing Han from the gangster [[Jabba the Hutt]], returns to Yoda to complete his training, only to find the 900-year-old Jedi Master on his deathbed. Before he dies, Yoda confirms that Vader is Luke's father. Moments later, Obi-Wan's spirit tells Luke that he must confront his father once again before he can become a Jedi, and that Leia is his twin sister.

As the Rebels attack the second Death Star, Luke engages Vader in another lightsaber duel as the Emperor watches; both Sith Lords intend to turn Luke to the dark side and take him as their apprentice. During the duel, Luke succumbs to his anger and brutally overpowers Vader, but controls himself at the last minute; realizing that he is about to suffer his father's fate, he spares Vader's life and proudly declares his allegiance to the Jedi. An enraged Palpatine then attempts to kill Luke with [[Force (Star Wars)#Force abilities|Force lightning]], a sight that moves Vader to turn and kill the Emperor, suffering mortal wounds in the process. Redeemed, Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms. Luke becomes a full-fledged Jedi, and the Rebels destroy the second Death Star.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 6&quot; /&gt;

The prequel trilogy begins (32 years before the original film) with the corrupt [[Trade Federation]] setting up a blockade of battleships around the planet [[Naboo]]. The Sith Lord Darth Sidious had secretly planned the blockade to give his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretense to overthrow and replace the Supreme Chancellor of the [[Galactic Republic (Star Wars)|Galactic Republic]]. At the Chancellor's request, the Jedi Knight [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his apprentice, a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi, are sent to Naboo to negotiate with the Federation. However, the two Jedi are forced to instead help the Queen of Naboo, [[Padmé Amidala]], escape from the blockade and plea her planet's crisis before the Republic Senate on [[Coruscant]]. When their starship is damaged during the escape, they land on Tatooine for repairs, where Qui-Gon discovers a nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon comes to believe that Anakin is the &quot;Chosen One&quot; foretold by Jedi [[prophecy]] to bring balance to the Force, and he helps liberate the boy from slavery. The Jedi Council, led by Yoda, reluctantly allows Obi-Wan to train Anakin after Qui-Gon is killed by Palpatine's first apprentice, [[Darth Maul]], during the Battle of Naboo.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 1&quot; /&gt;

The remainder of the prequel trilogy chronicles Anakin's gradual descent to the dark side as he fights in the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], which Palpatine secretly engineers to destroy the Jedi Order and lure Anakin into his service.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 2&quot;/&gt; Anakin and Padmé fall in love and secretly wed, and eventually Padmé becomes pregnant. Anakin has a prophetic vision of Padmé dying in childbirth, and Palpatine convinces him that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save her life. Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine's Sith teachings and is renamed Darth Vader.

While Palpatine re-organizes the Republic into the tyrannical Empire, Vader participates in the [[Great Jedi Purge|extermination of the Jedi Order]], culminating in a lightsaber duel between himself and Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]]. Obi-Wan defeats his former apprentice and friend, severing his limbs and leaving him to burn to death on the shores of a lava flow. Palpatine arrives shortly afterward and saves Vader by placing him into a mechanical black mask and suit of armor that serves as a permanent life support system. At the same time, Padmé dies while giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Obi-Wan and Yoda, now the only remaining Jedi alive, agree to separate the twins and keep them hidden from both Vader and the Emperor, until the time comes when Anakin's children can be used to help overthrow the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 3&quot; /&gt;

===Themes===
{{See also|Philosophy and religion in Star Wars|Force (Star Wars)}}
Aside from its well known [[technology in science fiction|science fictional technology]], ''Star Wars'' features elements such as [[knighthood]], [[chivalry]], and [[princess]]es that are related to archetypes of the fantasy genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmpireOfDreams&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]|medium=DVD|date=2004|publisher=Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Star Wars'' world, unlike fantasy and science-fiction films that featured sleek and futuristic settings, was portrayed as dirty and grimy. Lucas' vision of a &quot;used future&quot; was further popularized in the science fiction-horror films ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Legacy&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|title=The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars|publisher=Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was set on a dirty space freighter; ''[[Mad Max 2]]'', which is set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] desert; and ''[[Blade Runner]]'', which is set in a crumbling, dirty city of the future. Lucas made a conscious effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between films, and especially to parallel the journeys of Luke Skywalker with that of his father Anakin when making the prequels.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 1&quot; /&gt;

''Star Wars'' contains many themes of [[political science]] that mainly favor [[democracy]] over [[dictatorship]]. Political science has been an important element of ''Star Wars'' since the franchise first launched in 1977. The plot climax of ''Star Wars'' is modeled after the fall of the democratic [[Roman Republic]] and the formation of an [[Roman Empire|empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books/about/Star_Wars_and_History.html?id=m81Bg4E_y_IC |title=Star Wars and History - Lucasfilm - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= October 15, 2012|accessdate=August 30, 2013|isbn=9781118285251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utc.edu/Academic/FirstYearStudies/seminars/starwars.php ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/nights/audio/2388685/star-wars-and-the-roman-empire |title=Radio New Zealand : National : Nights : 26 Aug 2010 : Star Wars and the Roman Empire |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |date=August 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' also reflects on the events in America following the [[September 11 attacks]].

===Technical information===
All six films of the ''Star Wars'' series were shot in an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 2.39:1. The original trilogy was shot with [[anamorphic]] lenses. Episodes IV and V were shot in [[Panavision]], while Episode VI was shot in Joe Dunton Camera (JDC) scope. Episode I was shot with Hawk anamorphic lenses on [[Arri]]flex cameras, and Episodes II and III were shot with Sony's [[CineAlta]] high-definition digital cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url = http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/anamorphic/aspectratios/widescreenorama.html |title=Widescreen-O-Rama|publisher=The Digital Bits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas hired [[Ben Burtt]] to oversee the sound effects on ''A New Hope''. Burtt's accomplishment was such that the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] presented him with a Special Achievement Award because it had no award at the time for the work he had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Sergi | first = Gianluca|title=Tales of the Silent Blast: Star Wars and Sound|journal=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=March 1998|volume=26|issue=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucasfilm developed the [[THX]] sound reproduction standard for ''Return of the Jedi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.digihometheatre.com/surround-sound/thx.html|title=Quality Home Theater Systems Products |publisher=Digital Home Theater |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321035758/http://www.digihometheatre.com/surround-sound/thx.html |archivedate = March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Williams]] composed the [[Star Wars music|scores for all six films]].

Anderson trained actor [[Mark Hamill]] (Luke Skywalker) and performed all the sword stunts as Darth Vader during the lightsaber duels in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', wearing Vader's costume.

===Production history===

====Original trilogy====
{{Redirect |Original trilogy|the video game|Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy}}
[[File:George Lucas.jpg|left|thumb|[[George Lucas]], the creator of ''Star Wars'']]
In 1971, [[Universal Studios]] agreed to make ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and ''Star Wars'' in a two-picture contract, although ''Star Wars'' was later rejected in its early concept stages. ''American Graffiti'' was completed in 1973 and, a few months later, Lucas wrote a short summary called &quot;The Journal of the Whills&quot;, which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a &quot;Jedi-Bendu&quot; space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.{{Sfn |Rinzler| 2007| p= 8}} Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand, Lucas then began writing a 13-page treatment called ''The Star Wars'' on April 17, 1973, which had thematic parallels with [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]''.{{Sfn |Kaminski| 2007| p= 50}} By 1974, he had expanded the treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the [[Sith]], the [[Death Star]], and a protagonist named Annikin Starkiller.

For the second draft, Lucas made heavy simplifications, and introduced the young hero on a farm as Luke Starkiller. Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. &quot;[[Force (Star Wars)|The Force]]&quot; was also introduced as a mystical [[energy]] field. The next draft removed the father character and replaced him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi, and in 1976 a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography. The film was titled ''Adventures of Luke Starkiller, as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars''. During production, Lucas changed Luke's name to Skywalker and altered the title to simply ''The Star Wars'' and finally ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060628065925/http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2006|title=Starkiller |publisher=Jedi Bendu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Williams tux.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[John Williams]], composer of the musical [[Film score|scores]] for all six films of the original and prequel trilogies.]]
At that point, Lucas was not expecting the film to become part of a series. The fourth draft of the script underwent subtle changes that made it more satisfying as a self-contained film, ending with the destruction of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]] itself by way of destroying the Death Star. However, Lucas ''had'' previously conceived of the film as the first in a series of adventures. Later, he realized the film would not in fact be the first in the sequence, but a film in the second trilogy in the saga. This is stated explicitly in George Lucas' preface to the 1994 reissue of ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'':
{{Quote | It wasn't long after I began writing ''Star Wars'' that I realized the story was more than a single film could hold. As the saga of the Skywalkers and Jedi Knights unfolded, I began to see it as a tale that could take at least nine films to tell—three trilogies—and I realized, in making my way through the back story and after story, that I was really setting out to write the middle story.}}

The second draft contained a teaser for a never-made sequel about &quot;The Princess of Ondos,&quot; and by the time of the third draft some months later Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to make two sequels. Not long after, Lucas met with author [[Alan Dean Foster]], and hired him to write these two sequels as novels.{{Sfn |Rinzler| 2007| p = 107}} The intention was that if ''Star Wars'' were successful, Lucas could adapt the novels into screenplays.{{Sfn | Kaminski | 2007 | p = 38}} He had also by that point developed an elaborate backstory to aid his writing process.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p= 134}}

When ''Star Wars'' proved successful, Lucas decided to use the film as the basis for an elaborate [[Serial film|serial]], although at one point he considered walking away from the series altogether.{{Sfn |Kaminski| 2007| p=142}} However, Lucas wanted to create an independent filmmaking center—what would become [[Skywalker Ranch]]—and saw an opportunity to use the series as a financing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baxter | first = John| title= Mythmaker| year = 1999 | page = 173 | isbn=0-380-97833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Dean Foster had already begun writing the first sequel novel, but Lucas decided to abandon his plan to adapt Foster's work; the book was released as ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' the following year. At first Lucas envisioned a series of films with no set number of entries, like the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] series. In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in August 1977, he said that he wanted his friends to each take a turn at directing the films and giving unique interpretations on the series. He also said that the backstory in which Darth Vader turns to the dark side, kills Luke's father and fights [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] on a volcano as the [[Galactic Republic]] falls would make an excellent sequel.

Later that year, Lucas hired science fiction author [[Leigh Brackett]] to write ''Star Wars II'' with him. They held story conferences and, by late November 1977, Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment called ''The Empire Strikes Back''. The treatment is similar to the final film, except that Darth Vader does not reveal he is Luke's father. In the first draft that Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/starwarstrilogy1997.html | publisher = Hollywood Gothique | title= Star Wars: The Original Trilogy – Then And Now | last = Biodrowski | first = Steve | accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brackett finished her first draft in early 1978; Lucas has said he was disappointed with it, but before he could discuss it with her, she died of cancer.{{Sfn | Bouzereau |1997|p=144}} With no writer available, Lucas had to write his next draft himself. It was this draft in which Lucas first made use of the &quot;Episode&quot; numbering for the films; ''Empire Strikes Back'' was listed as ''Episode II''.{{Sfn |Bouzereau|1997|p=135}} As Michael Kaminski argues in ''The Secret History of Star Wars'', the disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions in which to take the story.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=161}} He made use of a new plot twist: Darth Vader claims to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggles writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more drafts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bouzereau 1997 123&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Bouzereau|1997|p= 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in April 1978. He also took the script to a darker extreme by having [[Han Solo]] imprisoned in [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] and left in [[limbo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 5&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]| year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new story point of Darth Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series. Michael Kaminski argues in his book that it is unlikely that the plot point had ever seriously been considered or even conceived of before 1978, and that the first film was clearly operating under an alternate storyline where Vader was separate from Luke's father;{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=120–21}} there is not a single reference to this plot point before 1978. After writing the second and third drafts of ''Empire Strikes Back'' in which the point was introduced, Lucas reviewed the new backstory he had created: Anakin Skywalker was Ben Kenobi's brilliant student and had a child named Luke, but was swayed to the dark side by Emperor [[Palpatine]] (who became a [[Sith]] and not simply a politician). Anakin battled Ben Kenobi on the site of a volcano and was wounded, but then resurrected as Darth Vader. Meanwhile Kenobi hid Luke on [[Tatooine]] while the Republic became the Empire and Vader systematically hunted down and killed the Jedi.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 164–65}}

With this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy, changing ''Empire Strikes Back'' from ''Episode II'' to ''Episode V'' in the next draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bouzereau 1997 123&quot; /&gt; [[Lawrence Kasdan]], who had just completed writing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', was then hired to write the next drafts, and was given additional input from director [[Irvin Kershner]]. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer [[Gary Kurtz]] saw the film as a more serious and adult film, which was helped by the new, darker storyline, and developed the series from the light adventure roots of the first film.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p= 178}}

By the time he began writing ''Episode VI'' in 1981 (then titled ''[[Return of the Jedi|Revenge of the Jedi]]''), much had changed. Making ''Empire Strikes Back'' was stressful and costly, and Lucas' personal life was disintegrating. Burned out and not wanting to make any more ''Star Wars'' films, he vowed that he was done with the series in a May 1983 interview with [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]. Lucas' 1981 rough drafts had Darth Vader competing with the Emperor for possession of Luke—and in the second script, the &quot;revised rough draft&quot;, Vader became a sympathetic character. Lawrence Kasdan was hired to take over once again and, in these final drafts, Vader was explicitly redeemed and finally unmasked. This change in character would provide a springboard to the &quot;Tragedy of Darth Vader&quot; storyline that underlies the prequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 28, 2008 |url=http://www.starwars.com/bio/lawrencekasdan.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606085730/http://www.starwars.com/bio/lawrencekasdan.html |archivedate=June 6, 2008 |title=Lawrence Kasdan |publisher=Star Wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prequel trilogy====
After losing much of his fortune in a divorce settlement in 1987, Lucas had no desire to return to ''Star Wars'', and had unofficially canceled his [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] by the time of ''Return of the Jedi''.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=227}} Nevertheless, the prequels, which were only still a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of &quot;The Star Wars&quot; continued to fascinate him with the possibilities of technical advances would make it possible to revisit his 20-year-old material. After ''Star Wars'' became popular once again, in the wake of [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]'s comic book line and [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Thrawn trilogy|trilogy of novels]], Lucas saw that there was still a large audience. His children were older, and with the explosion of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] technology he was now considering returning to directing.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=294–95}} By 1993 it was announced, in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' among other sources, that he would be making the prequels. He began penning more to the story, now indicating the series would be a tragic one examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals; at first they were supposed to be a &quot;filling-in&quot; of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a &quot;Saga&quot;.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 299–300}}

In 1994, Lucas finally had his first screenplay titled ''Episode I: The Beginning''. Following the release of that film, Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two, and began working on ''Episode II'' at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Star Wars Insider|title= Star Wars Insider|issue= 45|page= 19 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first draft of ''Episode II'' was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired [[Jonathan Hales]], a writer from ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', to polish it.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007| p= 371}} Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film &quot;Jar Jar's Great Adventure.&quot;{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=374}} In writing ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Lucas initially decided that [[Lando Calrissian]] was a [[cloning|clone]] and came from a planet of clones which caused the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; mentioned by Princess Leia in ''A New Hope'';{{Sfn |Bouzereau|1997|p=196}}{{Sfn |Kaminski |2008 |p= 158}} he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone shocktroopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were repelled by the Jedi.{{Sfn | Kaminski |2008 |p= 162}}  The basic elements of that backstory became the plot basis for ''Episode II'', with the new wrinkle added that Palpatine secretly orchestrated the crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 2&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|title= [[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]|publisher= [[20th Century Fox]]| date = 2002 | medium = DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas began working on ''Episode III'' before ''Attack of the Clones'' was released, offering concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven Clone War battles.{{Sfn |Rinzler|2005|pp= 13–15}} As he reviewed the storyline that summer, however, he says he radically re-organized the plot.{{Sfn |Rinzler|2005|p = 36}} Michael Kaminski, in ''The Secret History of Star Wars'', offers evidence that issues in Anakin's fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make massive story changes, first revising the opening sequence to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice, [[Count Dooku]], murdered by Anakin as the first act in the latter's turn towards the dark side.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=380–84}} After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin's character, re-writing his entire turn to the dark side; he would now turn primarily in a quest to save Padmé's life, rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several, including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were evil and plotting to take over the Republic. This fundamental re-write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage, and new and revised scenes filmed during pick-ups in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 3 documentary&quot;&gt;{{Cite video | title =Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith documentary &quot;Within a Minute&quot;|medium=DVD documentary|date= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas often exaggerated the amount of material he wrote for the series; much of it stemmed from the post‐1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon. Michael Kaminski explained that these exaggerations were both a publicity and security measure. Kaminski rationalized that since the series' story radically changed throughout the years, it was always Lucas' intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material from his perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;star wars 3&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]|medium= DVD|date= 2005|publisher= [[20th Century Fox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arnold 2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title= Director George Lucas Takes a Look Back—and Ahead| last =Arnold | first = William|publisher= Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = May 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; When congratulating the producers of the TV series ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'' in 2010, Lucas himself jokingly admitted, &quot;when ''Star Wars'' first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance. Throw in some father issues and references to other stories&amp;nbsp;– let's call them homages&amp;nbsp;– and you've got a series&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/george-lucas-sends-letter-lost-53645 | title = George Lucas sends letter to 'Lost' | work = Hollywood Reporter | date = November 30, 2010 | accessdate= November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sequel trilogy====
{{Main |Star Wars sequel trilogy}}
A sequel trilogy was reportedly planned (Episodes ''VII'', ''VIII'' and ''IX'') by [[Lucasfilm]] as a [[sequel]] to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy (Episodes ''IV'', ''V'' and ''VI''), released between 1977 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEDgFKFJPSFEID|title= Mark Hamill talks ''Star Wars'' 7, 8 and 9!|date= September 10, 2004|publisher=Movieweb|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the similarly discussed ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy (Episodes ''I'', ''II'' and ''III'') was ultimately released between 1999 and 2005, Lucasfilm and George Lucas had for many years denied plans for a sequel trilogy, insisting that ''Star Wars'' is meant to be a six-part series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killermovies.com/s/starwarsepisodeiii/articles/4415.html|title=George Lucas talks on ''Star Wars'' sequels 7, 8 &amp; 9|date=September 13, 2004|publisher=Killer Movies|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/GL01.HTM|title=George Lucas (''Star Wars'': Episode I)|first=Mr. Showbiz|publisher=Industry Central|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Start date|2008|5}}, speaking about the upcoming ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', Lucas maintained his status on the sequel trilogy:

{{quote|&quot;I get asked all the time, 'What happens after ''Return of the Jedi''?,' and there really is no answer for that.

In January 2012, Lucas announced that he would step away from blockbuster films and instead produce smaller [[Art film|art-house]] films. In an interview regarding whether or not the scrutiny he received from the prequel trilogy and the alterations made on the original trilogy were a factor in his retirement, Lucas stated:
{{quote|&quot;Why would I make any more,... when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/george-lucas-done-with-star-wars-red-tails_n_1210951.html |title=George Lucas Done With 'Star Wars' Fanboys, Talks 'Red Tails' |last= |first=|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October 2012, [[The Walt Disney Company]] agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that ''Star Wars Episode VII'' would be released in 2015. The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] became president of the company, reporting to [[Walt Disney Studios (production)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman [[Alan F.

On June 21, 2014 it was reported that ''[[Looper (film)|Looper]]'' director [[Rian Johnson]] would direct ''Episode VIII'' with Ram Bergman as a producer.

==Expanded Universe==
{{Main|Star Wars Expanded Universe}}
[[File:Boba Fet.jpg|thumb|upright|Cosplay of the ''Star Wars'' character, [[Boba Fett]]. The popular character was first incorporated in the Expanded Universe in the television film  ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' until appearing in the main film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-v/bts/article/f20061019/index.html|title=Proto-Fett: The Birth of Boba|last=Vilmur |first=Pete |date=October 19, 2006|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|page=1|accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term ''Expanded Universe'' (''EU'') is an umbrella term for officially licensed ''Star Wars'' material outside of the six feature films. The material expands the stories told in the films, taking place anywhere from 25,000 years before ''The Phantom Menace'' to 140 years after ''Return of the Jedi''. The first ''Expanded Universe'' story appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Star Wars'' #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues of the series having been an adaptation of the film), followed quickly by [[Alan Dean Foster]]'s novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://members.aol.com/heywood254/index.html|title=Lost Star Warriors|publisher=[[AOL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Disney's acquisition of the product, George Lucas retains [[artistic control]] over the ''Star Wars'' universe. For example, the death of central characters and similar changes in the status quo requires his approval before authors were allowed to proceed. In addition, Lucasfilm Licensing and the new Lucasfilm Story Group devote efforts to ensure continuity between the works of various authors across companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/05/06/DI2005050600821.html|title=Star Wars: George Lucas' Vision|work=Washington Post |date=May 19, 2005|author=Pollock, Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the Expanded Universe have been adopted by Lucas for use in the films, such as the name of capital planet [[Coruscant]], which first appeared in [[Timothy Zahn]]'s novel ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' before being used in ''The Phantom Menace''. Additionally, Lucas so liked the character [[Aayla Secura]], who was introduced in [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Star Wars'' series, that he included her as a character in ''Attack of the Clones''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/bts/profile/f20020618/index.html|title=From EU to Episode II: Aayla Secura|publisher=Star Wars|accessdate=January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas has played a large role in the production of various television projects, usually serving as storywriter or executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/859/859974p1.html|accessdate=March 27, 2008|title=Star Wars Live-Action Series Delayed|publisher=IGN|date=March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' has had [[Star Wars (radio)|numerous radio adaptations]]. A radio adaptation of ''A New Hope'' was first broadcast on [[National Public Radio]] in 1981. The adaptation was written by science fiction author [[Brian Daley]] and directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]]. It was followed by adaptations of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' in 1983 and ''Return of the Jedi'' in 1996. The adaptations included background material created by Lucas but not used in the films. [[Mark Hamill]], [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[Billy Dee Williams]] reprised their roles as [[Luke Skywalker]], [[C-3PO]], and [[Lando Calrissian]], respectively, except in ''Return of the Jedi'' in which Luke was played by Joshua Fardon and Lando by [[Arye Gross]]. The series also used John Williams' original score from the films and [[Ben Burtt]]'s original sound designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://theforce.net/timeline/film4.asp|title=Ultimate Timeline|publisher=The Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Lucasfilm strived to maintain internal consistency between the films and television content with the expanded universe, only the films and the second ''Clone Wars'' television series are regarded as absolute [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], since Lucas worked on them directly. On April 25, 2014—anticipating future film installments—the company announced that they had devised a &quot;story group&quot; to oversee and co-ordinate all creative development. The first new on-screen canon to be produced will be the television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. Previous EU titles will be re-reprinted under the &quot;Legends&quot; banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Legendary Star wars Universe Turns a New Page |date=April 25, 2014 |work=StarWars.com |publisher=[[Lucasfilm]] |url=http://starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page.html |accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other films===
In addition to the two trilogies and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' film, several other authorized films have been produced:
* ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', a 1978 two-hour [[television special]], shown only once and never released on video. Notable for the introduction of [[Boba Fett]].
* ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'', a 1984 American made-for-TV film—released theatrically overseas.
* ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'', a 1985 American made-for-TV film—released theatrically overseas.
* ''[[The Great Heep]]'', a 1986 animated television special from the ''[[Star Wars: Droids]]'' TV series.
* ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2]]'', a 2009 official comedy spoof primarily based on ''The Clone Wars'' film.

===Animated series===
Following the success of the ''Star Wars'' films and their subsequent merchandising, several animated television series have been created:
* ''[[Star Wars: Droids]]'', also known as ''Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO'', which premiered in September 1985, focused on the travels of R2-D2 and C-3PO as they shift through various owners/masters, and vaguely fills in the gaps between the events of ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''.
* ''[[Star Wars: Ewoks]]'', also known as ''Ewoks'', was simultaneously released in September 1985 and focused on the adventures of Wicket and various other recognizable [[Ewok]] characters from the original trilogy in the years leading up to ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]''.
* ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', an animated micro-series created by [[Genndy Tartakovsky]], which aired on [[Cartoon Network]] from November 2003 to March 2005.
* ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated series based on [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|the animated movie]] of the same name, which aired on [[Cartoon Network]] from October 2008 to March 2013. The final season of the series aired on [[Netflix]] in March 2014.
* ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://starwars.com/news/new-animated-series-star-wars-rebels-coming-fall-2014.html | title = Star wars | contribution = New animated series ‘Star wars Rebels’ coming Fall 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an animated series set between ''Episode III'' and ''Episode IV'' that premiered as a special on [[Disney Channel]] and aired on [[Disney XD]] beginning in October 2014.
* ''[[Star Wars Detours]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/starwarsdetours|title=Facebook - Star Wars Detours|work=Facebook|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an animated comedy series written by [[Brendan Hay]], who is a writer for the comedy news show ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and with creative consulting from the co-creators of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'': [[Seth Green]] and [[Matthew Senreich]]. The series will take place during the original trilogy and the setting will be remote from the front line of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Exclusive: Seth Green Talks ''Star Wars'' Series|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/110/1102556p1.html| date= June 29, 2010| last1 = Lieberman | first1 = Jason | first2 = Goldman | last2 = Eric|publisher=IGN|accessdate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Disney purchase, this series was put on indefinite hold.

===Literature===
{{Main|List of Star Wars novels|List of Star Wars comic books}}
''Star Wars''-based fiction predates the release of the first film, with the 1976 [[novelization]] of ''Star Wars'' ([[Ghostwriter|ghost-written]] by [[Alan Dean Foster]] and credited to Lucas). Foster's 1978 novel, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'', was the first Expanded Universe work to be released. In addition to filling in the time between ''A New Hope'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'', this additional content greatly expanded the ''Star Wars'' timeline before and after the film series. ''Star Wars'' fiction flourished during the time of the original trilogy (1977–83) but slowed to a trickle afterwards. In 1992, however, [[Timothy Zahn]]'s ''[[Thrawn trilogy]]'' debuted, sparking a new interest in the ''Star Wars'' universe. Since then, several hundred tie-in novels have been published by [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] and [[Random House|Del Rey]]. A similar resurgence in the Expanded Universe occurred in 1996 with the [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]] novel ''[[Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire|Shadows of the Empire]]'', set in between ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'', and accompanying video game and comic book series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url=http://www.alandeanfoster.com/version2.0/frameset.htm|title=Alan Dean Foster | work = Version 2.0 | date =March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LucasBooks radically changed the face of the ''Star Wars'' universe with the introduction of the ''[[The New Jedi Order|New Jedi Order]]'' series, which takes place some 20 years after ''Return of the Jedi'' and stars a host of new characters alongside series originals.  For younger audiences, three series have been introduced. The ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice|Jedi Apprentice]]'' series follows the adventures of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] in the years before ''The Phantom Menace''. The ''[[Jedi Quest]]'' series follows the adventures of Obi-Wan and his apprentice [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] in between ''The Phantom Menace'' and ''Attack of the Clones''. ''[[Star Wars: The Last of the Jedi|The Last of the Jedi]]'' series follows the adventures of Obi-Wan and another surviving Jedi almost immediately, set in between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope''.

Following Disney's purchase of the franchise, [[Disney Publishing Worldwide]] also announced that Del Rey would publish a new line of canon Star Wars books under the Lucasfilm Story Group being released starting in September on a bi-monthly schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|title=Disney, Del Rey to Launch New 'Star Wars' Book Line |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-del-rey-launch-new-698995|accessdate=April 25, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Star Wars Legends banner would be used for those Extended Universe materials that are in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for 'Star Wars' Expanded Universe|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973|accessdate=April 25, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marvel Comics]] published ''Star Wars'' comic book series and adaptations from 1977 to 1986. A wide variety of creators worked on this series, including [[Roy Thomas]], [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], [[Howard Chaykin]], [[Al Williamson]], [[Carmine Infantino]], [[Gene Day]], [[Walt Simonson]], [[Michael Golden (comics)|Michael Golden]], [[Chris Claremont]], [[Whilce Portacio]], [[Jo Duffy]], and [[Ron Frenz]].

In the late 1980s, Marvel announced it would publish a new ''Star Wars'' comic by [[Tom Veitch]] and [[Cam Kennedy]].  However, in December 1991, [[Dark Horse Comics]] acquired the ''Star Wars'' license and used it to launch a number of ambitious sequels to the original trilogy instead, including the popular ''[[Dark Empire]]'' stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.darkhorse.com/company/timeline.php|title= Company timeline|accessdate= April 16, 2008 |publisher= Dark Horse comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since gone on to publish a large number of original adventures set in the ''Star Wars'' universe.  There have also been parody comics, including ''[[Tag and Bink]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Kevin Rubio on the Return of Tag and Bink | url= http://www.darkhorse.com/news/interviews.php?id=1274| publisher= Dark Horse comics| date= March 30, 2006 | accessdate =April 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3, 2014, Marvel Comics, now a part of the Walt Disney Company, announced that it will once again publish ''Star Wars'' comic books and graphic novels, taking over from Dark Horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwars.com/news/lucasfilm-and-marvel-join-forces-to-publish-star-wars-comics-and-graphic-novels.html|title=Disney's Lucasfilm and Marvel Entertainment Join Forces to Publish Star Wars Comics and Graphic Novels|work=StarWars.com|date=January 3, 2014|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===

Since 1977, dozens of [[Board game|board]], [[Card game|card]], [[Video game|video]], [[Miniature wargaming|miniature]], and [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, among other types, have been published bearing the ''Star Wars'' name, beginning in 1977 with the board game ''Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4845/star-wars--escape-from-death-star-game | title = Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star | year = 1977 | type = description | publisher = Board game geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with another board game with the same title, published in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2725/star-wars-escape-from-the-death-star | title = Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star | year = 1990 | type = description | publisher = Board game geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' video games [[commercialization]] started in 1982 with ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (Parker Bros. game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' published for the [[Atari 2600]] by [[Parker Brothers]]. Since then, ''Star Wars'' has opened the way to a myriad of [[space simulator|space-flight simulation games]], [[first-person shooter|first-person shooter games]], [[role-playing video game]]s, [[real-time strategy|RTS]] games, and others. Three different official tabletop [[role-playing game]]s have been developed for the ''Star Wars'' universe: [[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game|a version by West End Games]] in the 1980s and 1990s, [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Wizards of the Coast)|one by Wizards of the Coast]] in the 2000s and [[Star Wars Roleplaying Game (Fantasy Flight Games)|one by Fantasy Flight Games]] in the 2010s.

While ''The Complete Saga'' focuses on all six episodes of the series, ''The Force Unleashed'', of the same name of the [[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (project)|multimedia project which it is a part of]], takes place in the largely unexplored time period between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope'' and casts players as [[Darth Vader]]'s &quot;secret apprentice&quot; hunting down the remaining Jedi.

''Star Wars'' [[Star Wars Trading Cards|trading cards]] have been published since the first 'blue' series, by [[Topps]], in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate = March 27, 2008| url= http://starwarscards.net/|title= Star Wars Trading Cards|publisher= Star Wars cards}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of series have been produced, with [[Topps]] being the licensed creator in the United States.  Some of the card series are of film stills, while others are original art.  Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare &quot;promos&quot;, such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II &quot;floating Yoda&quot; P3 card often commanding US$ 1 000 or more.  While most &quot;base&quot; or &quot;common card&quot; sets are plentiful, many &quot;insert&quot; or &quot;[[Trading card|chase cards]]&quot; are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate= March 28, 2008|url= http://theswca.com/textf/promo.html | title = Star Wars Promotional Trading Card List |publisher=The Star Wars Collectors Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 until 2001, [[Decipher, Inc.]] had the license for, created and produced a collectible card game based on ''Star Wars''; the ''Star Wars Collectible Card Game'' (also known as [[SWCCG]]).

===Fan works===
{{Main |Star Wars fan films}}
The ''Star Wars'' saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating [[fan film]]s. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official ''Star Wars'' Fan Film Awards]], officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] issues, however, the contest was initially open only to [[parody|parodies]], [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], and documentaries. Fan-fiction films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25279212_ITM |title=Filmmaker Kevin Smith Hosts ‘The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards' on SCI FI Channel; George Lucas to Present Special Honor | work  = [[Business Wire]]|date=April 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story, they are not considered an official part of the ''Star Wars'' [[Star Wars canon|canon]]. However, the lead character from the ''[[Pink Five]]'' series was incorporated into [[Timothy Zahn]]'s 2007 novel ''[[Allegiance (novel)|Allegiance]]'', marking the first time a fan-created ''Star Wars'' character has ever crossed into the official canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20080727-9999-1a27starfilm.html | work = The San Diego Union Tribune | title= Final installment of 'Star Wars' parody is out there - somewhere | author=Peter Rowe | accessdate=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan-fiction works, so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the ''Star Wars'' franchise in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Sarah | last= Knapton|title= Court to rule in Star Wars costume battle|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2271561,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = April 7, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
[[File:StarToursEntrance96 wb.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The original ''Star Tours'' ride at Disneyland in 1996.]]
Before Disney's acquisition of the franchise, George Lucas had established a partnership in 1986 with Disney and its [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] division to create [[Star Tours]], an attraction that opened at [[Disneyland]] in 1987. The attraction also had subsequent incarnations at other [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] worldwide, with the exception of [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].

The attractions at Disneyland and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] closed in 2010 and at [[Tokyo Disneyland]] in 2012 to allow the rides to be converted into [[Star Tours—The Adventures Continue]]. The successor attraction opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disneyland in 2011, and Tokyo Disneyland in 2013.

The [[Jedi Training Academy]] is a live show where children are selected to learn the teachings of the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]] and [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]  to become [[Jedi|Padawan learners]]. The show is present at the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebels]] stage at Disney's Hollywood Studios and at the [[Tomorrowland Terrace]] at Disneyland.

The [[Walt Disney World Resort]]'s [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] park hosts an annual festival, [[Star Wars Weekends|''Star Wars'' Weekends]] during specific dates from May to June. The event began in 1997.

In August 2014 it was reported that in 2015, Walt Disney Co. plans to add a major ''Star Wars'' presence in all of their theme parks which is rumored to include a ''Star Wars'' themed expansion of their Hollywood Studios theme park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/significant-star-wars-presence-planned-for-disney-theme-parks-1201276296/|title=Advertisement|work=Variety|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked whether or not Disney has an intellectual property franchise that’s comparable to ''[[Harry Potter]]'' at [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|Universal theme parks]], Disney chairman [[Robert Iger|Bob Iger]] mentioned ''[[Cars]]'' and the [[Disney Princesses]], and promised that ''Star Wars'', “is going to be just that.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/08/05/disney-theme-parks-star-wars/|title=Disney plans expanded 'Star Wars' presence at theme parks|work=EW.com|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal species named after ''Star Wars'' characters==
Several animal species have been named after ''Star Wars'' characters.
* ''[[Han (trilobite)|Han solo]]'' &lt;small&gt;Turvey, 2005&lt;/small&gt;, is a species of [[agnostid]] [[trilobite]] found in the [[Ordovician]] [[Zitai Formation]] of southern China. According to the scientific publication, the genus name ''Han'' refers to the [[Han Chinese]], and the species name ''solo'' to the species being the youngest [[Diplagnostidae]] fossil found to that date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turvey 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author= Samuel T.

The ''Star Wars'' saga has had a significant impact on modern American [[popular culture|pop culture]]. Both the films and characters have been parodied in numerous films and television.
* Notable film parodies of ''Star Wars'' include ''[[Hardware Wars]]'', a 13-minute 1977 spoof which Lucas has called his favorite ''Star Wars'' parody, and ''[[Spaceballs]]'', a feature film by [[Mel Brooks]] which featured effects done by Lucas' Industrial Light &amp; Magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url = http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/feature/2002/05/21/hardware_wars/ | title= &quot;Hardware Wars&quot;: The movie, the legend, the household appliances| work = [[Salon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|title=[[Spaceballs]]|people=Mel Brooks |medium= DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* During the 2012 [[Emerald City Comicon]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] several prominent cartoon voice-over actors including [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Jess Harnell]], [[John DiMaggio]], [[Maurice LaMarche]] [[Tara Strong]] and [[Kevin Conroy]] performed a parody reading of ''A New Hope'' as a radio play in each of their signature cartoon character voices; i.e. Harnell and Paulsen as Wakko and Yakko Warner from ''[[Animaniacs]]'', Strong as Bubbles from ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and Timmy Turner from ''[[The Fairly Oddparents]]'', LaMarche and DiMaggio as Kiff Kroker and Bender Rodriguez from ''[[Futurama]]'', and Conroy narrating as [[Batman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBzRmWeC6Ds | contribution = ECCC 2012: Star Wars Trilogy: The Radio Play – Official | type =  video | title = You tube | publisher = Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When [[Ronald Reagan]] proposed the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), a system of lasers and missiles meant to intercept incoming [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]], the plan was quickly labeled &quot;Star Wars,&quot; implying that it was science fiction and linking it to Ronald Reagan's acting career. According to [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]], Reagan was annoyed by this, but Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Richard Perle]] told colleagues that he &quot;thought the name was not so bad.&quot;; &quot;'Why not?' he said.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11383">The epic [[space opera]] blockbuster '''[[Star Wars]]''' borrows many real-life scientific and technological concepts in its settings. In return ''Star Wars'' has predicted and inspired/influenced several futuristic technologies in existence and under development. While many of these technologies are in existence and in use today, they are not nearly as complex as seen in ''Star Wars''. Some of these technologies are not even considered possible in modern times. However, many of the technologies depicted by ''Star Wars'' parallel modern real-life technologies, though with significant differences, but still using the same concepts.

==Prosthetics==
{{main|prosthetics}}
Prosthetics was first seen in ''Star Wars'' in the fifth film of the saga (though produced second by date) ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]''. This technology seen in the films bears an almost absolute resemblance to natural limbs and other body parts save for the distinctive material they are made of compared to [[organic matter|organic material]] the natural limbs and other organs they replace.
Such precision is not considered possible by current technological means, however the ability for prosthetics to produce feeling has become closer to reality according to recent research and development conducted at the [[Case Western University]] which produced prosthetic limbs similar to the ones seen in ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gizmodo.com/science-has-built-luke-skywalkers-robotic-hand-touch-a-514136302 Science Has Built Luke Skywalker's Robotic Hand, Touch and All&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar production even closer to natural organic limbs known as the DEKA Arm System and dubbed as &quot;The Luke&quot; after [[Luke Skywalker]]'s prosthetic arm was approved for mass production by the US Food and Drug administration after eight years of testing and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/158048-natural-robotic-arm-approved/ Star Wars-style robotic arm approved for mass production — RT News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar Power Technology==
{{main|solar technology}}
Solar Power Technology is not commonly seen in the ''Star Wars'' universe except on the [[TIE fighters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scifi.about.com/od/starwarsglossaryandfaq/a/Star-Wars-Glossary-Tie-Fighter.htm TIE Fighter - Star Wars Glossary - What is a TIE Fighter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A distinct feature is that while TIE fighters are short-ranged, their solar panels still provide large scales of energy in propulsion as well as laser cannons for a set of just two solar panels limited in size.

==Robotics==
{{main|robotics|military robots|Droid (robot)}}
''Star Wars'' beholds advanced robotics which parallels current robotics technology and more. Robotics in ''Star Wars'' is generally divided into two categories, as in reality: military and civil.

===Civil===
The robots in the ''Star Wars'' universe, whether military or civilian, are both multi-purpose use and single purpose types. For example [[Star Wars characters#|21-B]] is built for and functions for the sole purpose of performing medical tasks, ranging from basic to advanced.

Others, such as humanoid protocol droids like [[C-3PO]] are built for multi-task purposes from basic physical chores to translating between different languages and other forms of communication, including with sophisticated computers and other forms of artificial intelligence.

Other non-humanoid barrel shaped robots such as [[R2-D2]] also are built with multi-purpose features and capabilities which include repairing and programing advanced devices as well as maintaining them.
The basic concepts and purposes for robotics in Star Wars as in real-life is to perform tasks to reduce human labor, assist humans with more sophisticated requirements as well as store and manage sophisticated data/information. Also parallel to the modern world is the use of robots for tasks and chores not considered safe or acceptable for humans. Robots are also seen as a source of cutting human labor costs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.dairyherd.com/dairy-news/Star-Wars-meets-agriculture.html Star Wars meets agriculture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[NASA]] developed robots inspired by the training remotes seen in the Star Wars films and comics used by the [[Jedi]] for combat training with a [[lightsaber]]. These robots were used in NASA space stations for experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spheres.html NASA - NASA Expanding Tests of Star Wars-Inspired &quot;Droids&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another individual hacker also developed similar robots based on the same hovering Jedi training robots from Star Wars but given the ability to float within a limited magnetic range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/2010/11/hacker-builds-floating-jedi-training-remote-droid/ Hacker Builds Floating Jedi-Training Remote Droid | Gadget Lab | WIRED&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
{{See also|UAV}}
Military robots in the ''Star Wars'' universe are also built on the same principles as modern military robotics. While most military robots in the modern world are designed in various shapes and forms, depending on their primary specific purpose(s), the military robots of the ''Star Wars'' universe are primarily humanoid and built to imitate live [[Living organisms|organic]] soldiers, primarily human.

A major similarity between modern Earth military robotics and that of the ''Star Wars'' universe is that different robots are built and designed for different specific purposes, whether ground warfare, maritime warfare, aerial warfare or space warfare as seen in the Star Wars prequel films.
Such practices are considered unpractical and unfeasible by current means given the sophistication and resources each individual unit would require.

Another significant recognisable distinction of the robots in the ''Star Wars'' universe, weather military or civilian, is their stronger sense of independence and self-awareness compared to the robots of the modern world. Despite their current limited abilities, Dr Jonathan Roberts, director of CSTRO Autonomous Systems Laboratory proclaims that the role of robots in assisting humans is going to increase, similar to what is seen in Star Wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/May-the-fourth-be-with-the-bots.aspx May-the-fourth be with the bots | CSIRO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[United States military]] built a robot they claim was modelled after C-3PO but appears to function for both military and civilian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2217593/U-S-Navy-builds-robot-modelled-Star-Wars-character-C-3PO-fight-fires-board-warships.html U.S. Navy builds robot modeled on Star Wars character C-3PO to fight fires on board warships | Mail Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cloning and Genetic Engineering==
{{main|Cloning|Genetic Engineering|Biotechnology}}{{See also|Clone trooper}}
Star Wars also features the process of cloning and genetic engineering, though far more advanced and sophisticated compared to modern scientific and technological standards.

Cloning was first mentioned in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' and it's novelisation. It was first seen on film in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]''. There are major differences however between the current ability to clone humans and those seen in ''Star Wars''.

Current human cloning methods need to use the [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] (SCNT) which requires a female egg donor and have its nucleus removed, resulting in an enucleated egg. [[DNA]] from the subject being cloned would be extracted and electronically fused together with the enucleated egg. A surrogate mother needs to be impregnated with the embryos and give birth to the clone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/human-cloning1.htm HowStuffWorks &quot;How Human Cloning Will Work&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning in ''Star Wars'' does not seem to use this process and instead depicts advanced machinery that directly processes the human subjects DNA and directly produces the clone or clones by the thousands if desired. The clones in ''Star Wars'' can also be genetically altered to have their growth and learning accelerated as well as their independence and self-consciousness restricted.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeanne Cavelos]], a [[science fiction]] writer and former NASA [[astrophysicist]] who is also author of the book ''[[The Science of Star Wars]]'', all of this is future possibility with the progress of science and technology. What is ''not'' possible according to her is the ability to accelerate the growth of clones or their ability to learn faster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-of-star-wars-clone-wars/ The Science of Star Wars: The Clone Wars-Q&amp;A with Author Jeanne Cavelos - Scientific American&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holography==
{{main|holography}}
Holography was first seen in the first Star Wars film [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]. Holographs were used for various purposes, mainly for communication. At the time of the release of the original Star Wars films, holographic technology in [[Three Dimensional|3D]] format as seen in the films were not available. However, according to [[MailOnline]], recent technological breakthroughs have made 3D holograms a possibility. MailOnline goes to further state that 3D holographics as seen in the original Star Wars films could be built for less than three hundred and twenty British pounds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2344562/Star-Wars-style-moving-holograms-longer-lightyears-away-breakthrough-3D-technology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neowin]] reports that research conducted by [[Microsoft]] has brought about the creation of 3D holographic technology. The technology is intended be used for various kinds of purposes such as plotting data on maps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-research-reveals-holograph-brings-star-wars-leia-hologram-to-life&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ExtremeTech]] reports that smartphones created at HP labs are now bringing 3D holographic technology from Star Wars closer to reality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/180798-leia-aims-to-bring-interactive-star-wars-holographic-displays-to-your-phone&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars''''' (aka '''''Episode IVa: May the Ferb Be with You''''') is a 1-hour long [[Fictional crossover#Animation|crossover]] episode of the animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', that featured characters from [[Star Wars]].  It aired on July 26, 2014, on [[Disney Channel]] and aired on August 4, 2014, on [[Disney XD]].  The story is called non-canonical, but tells the story of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' in the style of ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', where the ''Phineas and Ferb'' characters interact with the ''Star Wars'' characters.

==Plot==
[[Perry the Platypus|Perry the &quot;Rebelpus&quot;]], the Rebel Alliance's best platypus agent, is shown breaking into the Imperial Corporate Offices-a [[Star Destroyer]] with an office building on top of it-and stealing a disc containing the plans for the [[Death Star]]. Following his escape, he rendezvous with [[Princess Leia]]'s ship and is complimented on his success by his superior officer, Major Hologram (Major Monogram of the main series). Meanwhile on the planet [[Tattooine]], [[Phineas Flynn]] and [[Ferb Fletcher]] are shown living with their parents as contented moisture farmers-with the same propensity for beyond-belief gadgetry-unlike neighbor [[Luke Skywalker]]. Darth Vader's Star Destroyer intercepts Leia's ship, forcing her to load the disc into [[R2-D2]]. As she does this, she is observed by a trio of [[Imperial stormtroopers]]: [[Candace Flynn]], [[Baljeet Tjinder]] and [[Buford van Stomm]]. Candace attempts to report the actions of the Rebels-whom she joined the Empire to &quot;bust&quot; due to their evil reputation-but is put down by her commanding officer, as she and her two cohorts are tasked with finding socks for [[Darth Vader]]. After seeing Artoo and [[C-3PO]] entering an escape pod, the trio decide to pursue them and prove their worth by recapturing the lost plans.

Elsewhere, the evil Darthenshmirtz ([[Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] in a Darth Vader-esque costume) arrives with his robotic underling Norm-3P0 (Norm from Phineas and Ferb) at the Death Star (which was apparently based on a handheld laser nutcracker that he invented). In conversation with Norm, he reveals that he has a new invention that is even more evil, but that requires the [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]] to power it. Back on Tattooine, Candace and her companions are on the trail of the droids-as is Perry-until their commander sends them into [[Mos Eisley]] to shop for socks for Darth Vader. Perry continues trailing the droids as they are seized by [[Jawa]]s and then sold to [[Owen Lars]], and eventually absconds with Artoo. Unfortunately, they accidentally run into Phineas and Ferb on their way to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s, whom Phineas and Ferb are acquainted with as he has given them instruction in the [[Jedi]] arts. Despite their offer of a ride, Artoo continues on his own while Perry remains unseen by the duo, unaware that their collision has resulted in the Death Star disc remaining in the back seat of Phineas and Ferb's speeder.

Upon discovering the disc, Phineas and Ferb set out to return it to Artoo, which takes them to Mos Eisley where they encounter [[Watto]]'s son Blatto, whom they are regular customers of. With Blatto's help they discover that the disc contains the Death Star plans, and they are pursued after being spotted by Candace's trio. The brothers just miss Artoo departing with Luke, Obi-Wan, Threepio, [[Han Solo]], and [[Chewbacca]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Determined to return the disc, the pair travel to the Mos Eisley cantina and are introduced to [[Isabella Garcia-Shapiro]], captain of the ''Centennial Chihuahua'' and an old rival of Han Solo's. Isabella agrees to transport them; meanwhile, Candace and her comrades are forced to ride a bus transport back to the Death Star. Meanwhile, in his evil lair aboard the Death Star, Darthenshmirtz continues his scheming, and learns that he can extract Force energy from Darth Vader's trash just before the planet [[Alderaan]] is destroyed. The ''Chihuahua'' catches up to the ''Falcon'', but both end up caught in a tractor beam; the ''Chihuahua'' is freed after Isabella-displaying a loner personality-is convinced to let Phineas and Ferb modify the ship so that it can take on the appearance of a donut truck.

Once aboard the Death Star, Phineas and Ferb are surprised and delighted to run into Perry, who was their pet before they discovered him to be a rebel agent, an event that initially upset them but that they have come to terms with. Perry makes his way to Darthenshmirtz's lair, only to end up encased in [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] and left helpless as Darthenshmirtz unveils his new [[Sith]]-inator, a machine that will make him a Sith Lord even more evil than Vader. Ferb, sensing through the Force that Perry is in danger, leaves Phineas and Isabella to go to his aid, unknowingly passing Obi-Wan Kenobi on the way. He then knocks Perry's carbonite slab out of the way of a blast from the Sith-inator only to be hit himself, which begins his transformation into a Sith by giving him yellow irises (identical to [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s transformation in [[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]). Elsewhere, Isabella and Phineas run into Candace, who pursues them, only to be saved from a fatal fall by Phineas, which causes her to rethink her stance on the Rebels. Darthenshmirtz is then attacked by a freed Perry, while Phineas gives Isabella the Death Star disc to take to the Rebels while he goes looking for Ferb.

Entering Darthenshmirtz's lair, Phineas discovers an upgraded Sith-inator and Ferb, who has taken on an appearance similar to that of [[Darth Maul]]. Upon learning that his brother intends to create an army of Sith and rule the Dark Side, Phineas reluctantly confronts him in a lightsaber duel, in which both of them upgrade their lightsabers to possess multiple blades. Isabella travels to [[Yavin]] and delivers the Death Star plans, but despite the appeals of the Firestar Girls (Rebel versions of the Fireside Girls) refuses to join the [[Rebel Alliance]]. She changes her mind after a tense conversation with Han and Chewbacca; back on the Death Star, Candace and her two comrades likewise decide to join the rebellion. The battles between Perry and Darthenshmirtz and Phineas and Ferb continue and intersect, until Candace comes to Phineas' aid. Together they manage to destroy the Sith-inator, which restores Ferb to normal, and the trio-along with Baljeet and Buford-depart to get to the bus that brought the stormtroopers to the Death Star. Perry also leaves with a carbonite-encased Darthenshmirtz, while the rebels begin their attack on the Death Star.

Left stranded on the doomed battle station, the heroes lament their situation, and Candace learns that Phineas is her baby brother and that their mother remarried, making Ferb their stepbrother. Before Phineas can expound on the subject, the Death Star detonates (a nod to the creators' decision not to touch on the history of how Phineas and Ferb's blended family came to be). Fortunately, Isabella returns in the nick of time and saves the group, while the Firestar Girls rescue all of the civilian personnel from the Death Star. Darthenshmirtz escapes Perry, threatening to return for a sequel, while the Platypus makes his way to Yavin to join the celebration attending the Death Star's destruction. The rebels (Phineas and Ferb's group included) then enjoy a dance party with music provided by Vanessa the Twi'lek (an alien version of Dr. Doofenshmirtz's daughter), during which Isabella kisses Phineas on the lips.

==Production==
After production on &quot;[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]&quot; was complete, the [[Walt Disney Company]] purchased [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm Limited]] for US $4.05 billion in cash and stock.  After co-creator [[Dan Povenmire]] heard this news, he did a doodle of [[Doofenshmirtz]] dressed as [[Darth Vader]], texted it to the head of Disney Television Animation and wrote, &quot;I smell crossover!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Phineas-Ferb-Premiere-1067309.aspx|title=Disney Channel Sets Premiere Date for ''Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel''|first=Michael|last=Schneider|work=TVGuide.com|date=2013-06-28|accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much like ''Mission Marvel'' before it, this special was announced at [[Comic-Con International]] 2013. Povenmire said, &quot;[[may the Force be with you|May The 'Ferb' Be With You]] and with all of us who for decades have dreamt of a chance to work with the great characters and stories of Star Wars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2013/07/19/doof-meets-darth-in-an-epic-ode-to-star-wars-from-the-hit-animated-series-phineas-and-ferb-626022/20130719disney01/#xlDugkRQT86EiyiF.99|title=Doof Meets Darth in an Epic Ode to Star Wars from the Hit Animated Series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;|author=Disney Channel|work=The Futon Critic|date=2013-07-19|accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the original ''Star Wars'' actors reprised their roles for this special.  Voice actor [[Christopher Corey Smith]] voiced [[Luke Skywalker]] as well the [[Toydarian]], Blatto, the son of [[Watto]] from ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hellofathead/status/484904403414310912|title=@hulitherium @animag @rwmead @DanPovenmire @mmonogram that's Watto's son, Blatto.|first=Robert F.|last=Hughes|work=Twitter|date=2014-07-03|accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; actor [[Ross Marquand]] played [[Han Solo]]; voice actress [[April Winchell]] played [[Princess Leia]]; writer Eddie Pittman provided one line as Darth Vader; regular [[Perry the Platypus]] voice actor [[Dee Bradley Baker]] also growled for [[Chewbacca]]; and comedian [[Simon Pegg]] provided the voice of [[C-3PO]] as well as the voice of Candace's unnamed commanding officer.

===Critical reception===
This special received positive reviews from critics. Most reviews so far have complimented the show for not simply reenacting the entire film as most parodies tend to do. [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]'s Amy Ratcliffe stated &quot;The mix proves to be an amusing one, and you don’t have to be familiar with Phineas and Ferb to enjoy the mash-up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/07/review-phineas-and-ferb-star-wars/|title=Review: PHINEAS AND FERB: STAR WARS|first=Amy|last=Ratcliffe|work=Nerdist|publisher=Nerdist Industries|date=2014-07-21|accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Matt Blum from [[GeekDad]] called it &quot;one of the best ''Star Wars'' cartoons ever, and a terrific episode of ''Phineas and Ferb'' as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geekdad.com/2014/07/phineas-ferb-star-wars-review/|title=Review: ''Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars'' – with Exclusive Clip!|first=Matt|last=Blum|work=GeekDad.com|date=2014-07-21|accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rick Ellis of Allyourscreens.com wrote that the special &quot;retains the best of 'Phineas And Ferb' while including an impressively funny collection of 'Star Wars' references, inside jokes and facts that only a hardcore fan might catch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allyourscreens.com/index.php/tv-reviews/1841-review-phineas-and-ferb-star-wars|title=Review: 'Phineas and Ferb Star Wars'|first=Rick|last=Ellis|work=AllYourScreens.com|date=2014-07-23|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
